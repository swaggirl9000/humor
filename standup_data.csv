Donald_Glover,33.29229245452908,34.18258598955519,The sweetest thing he was allowed was mints. He was just allowed to have mints.
Donald_Glover,37.7906176841347,53.44104087880425,So he would steal mints by the handful.
Donald_Glover,68.88060507833603,73.82407707545471,"And I would take him to the park and I was the only boy there, you know, I was hanging out. You know, they were cool."
Donald_Glover,85.49160813974429,88.60763551233568,"You know, we'd trade jerk- chicken recipes and stuff."
Donald_Glover,107.8426616243472,110.95868899693859,"And he goes, ""Shut up."" And she goes, ""Don't you talk to me like that, I am a grown-up, you will respect me."""

Anthony_Jeselnik,34.87411898446381,36.23345964380447,"Weird joke to clap for, but sure."
Anthony_Jeselnik,43.756707086017435,48.91282682834407,My mom actually should've been on one of the planes that crashed on 9/11.
Anthony_Jeselnik,86.5056271314892,88.49776430466086,"And when I did that, my mom would act weird. She'd pull me aside and say, ""Anthony, who's your new friend?"
Anthony_Jeselnik,93.98200075786283,100.70839333080713,"And I would say, ""Shut up, Mom, that's racist. Put your money away."
Anthony_Jeselnik,114.65335354300872,120.2782114437287,"And we never talk, write letters or any of that shit. 'Cause they're all in jail for the exact same thing."
Chelsea_Peretti,13.212189973614773,18.87791556728232,It was a photoset of 500 photos. I'm not exaggerating.

Chelsea_Peretti,59.00817941952506,67.30693931398416,"She calls him by a word that I really feel is one of the more disgusting words in the English language. She calls him her ""hubby,"" which, to me is on par with the ""N"" word."
Chelsea_Peretti,69.09364116094986,72.4554617414248,My hubby fixed the door. My hubby is sleeping.
Chelsea_Peretti,74.38321899736147,88.4887598944591,"He breathed in, he breathed out. He breathed in, he breathed out."""
Louis_CK,17.375394646533973,20.77031571722718,"Jesus was Jewish. And he said, ""I don't think so."""
Louis_CK,31.709505833905286,41.44632807137955,"He was like, ""Dude, Jesus couldn't be Jewish. Think about it."""
Louis_CK,45.124159231297185,48.943445435827044,What was he? Catholic?
Louis_CK,49.34423472889499,55.403225806451616,"Okay, Jesus was Catholic and he had a gold chain with a cross."
Louis_CK,57.94941660947152,64.03198352779684,"""That finally makes sense. I didn't even know."
Louis_CK,65.54083733699383,67.37975291695264,"Oh, fuck, that's me!"
John_Mulaney,32.54615096460011,40.02075294999063,"And I said, ""Of course I did! On an unrelated note, I'm going to walk out the front door right now."""
John_Mulaney,41.33290878441655,55.48544671286757,"It was charitable, but it was also fast and violent, because I was throwing boxes at people. The boxes were so heavy I couldn't even say what was in them."
John_Mulaney,59.49220827870387,65.86553661734406,"He's like, ""Take this receipt for the clothing for your taxes."" How do I write that on my taxes?"

John_Mulaney,73.527589436224,74.20709870762315,That sleep shirt bullshit.
John_Mulaney,83.9076793407005,85.89934444652556,"""Well, if it's too big you can just wear it as a sleep shirt."""
John_Mulaney,97.75560966473121,105.9800149840794,"""Because we don't say that when someone gives us a gift because that would not be polite."" Oh, I get it."
John_Mulaney,113.78265592807641,125.07656864581381,"So rather than violate these meaningless politeness rules, I'll just go to bed in a smock like goddamn Ebenezer Scrooge."

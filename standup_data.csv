Nate_Bargatze,39.95333817126269,41.33913884857281,I've never seen someone cry this much. It's over nothing.
Nate_Bargatze,52.28461538461538,55.0562167392356,"She just sits there on her iPad. She wants to be a YouTuber, which, as a comedian, makes me furious."
Nate_Bargatze,66.98819545234639,74.99765360425737,None of this is anywhere but my phone. I got 90 hours of this.
Nate_Bargatze,85.68476052249636,90.49983067247217,"""You want to see me open it?"" It's got five billion views."
Nate_Bargatze,95.1035074987905,97.07651185292694,"It looks like we buy her nothing, like, we just show her. ""If you wanna watch a kid have fun, but you'll never have fun in this house!"""
Nate_Bargatze_2,10.171,12.779,"Third grade, you're like, ""Okay."" They throw some stuff in, you're like, ""Oh, all right."
Nate_Bargatze_2,15.292,19.38,"All right."" It's, uh... ""Okay, learning it earlier than we used to, huh?"""
Nate_Bargatze_2,25.393,27.907,Just give it to parents that never learned it. Uh...
Nate_Bargatze_2,43.575,46.371,"If you don't know Common Core, it's just a new math. And the goal of Common Core is to use one sheet of paper for every problem."
Nate_Bargatze_2,49.8712,51.703,"You... You just want to keep breaking the problem down. You put the problem at the top, and it just keeps going."
Nate_Bargatze_2,58.881,62.509,"Just do that at the top. I don't even know what we're doing."""
Nate_Bargatze_2,67.865,70.543,"Old math still... I don't get incorrect change everywhere, just going, ""This stupid old math!"""
Nate_Bargatze_2,90.537,93.376,"""No, it works. I use it, a lot of people still use it, but the new way is to go jump the fence and come in the back and meet me at this same spot."""
Nate_Bargatze_TK,9.292,11.846,"He's done that my entire life. He was a clown at the very beginning, just in case you're like, ""How do you get into something like that?"""
Nate_Bargatze_TK,16.367,22.782,There's two steps. You can take them in either order.
Nate_Bargatze_TK,26.02,27.421,It was never weird to me. I thought everybody's dad was a clown.
Nate_Bargatze_TK,48.091,50.253,And... The Easter Bunny was in the passenger seat.
Nate_Bargatze_TK,55.689,59.162,"That's the first thing that I remember, to my life. If you want to know how you get into comedy, that's a pretty good nudge."
Nate_Bargatze_TK,72.16,74.112,"Like, he couldn't sit normal, so his head was bent to the side. And I remember he had his seat belt on, and he's just like... and I was like..."
Nate_Bargatze_TK,80.708,83.245,"I like to think about all the other people that saw that. Just in the car next to them, just at a red light, you're like, ""I didn't even know they hung out like that."""
Nate_Bargatze_TK_2,13.984,15.303,"It was right outside Louisville, Kentucky, where my parents are from. And my cousin's name is Tuesday, which is a good start."
Nate_Bargatze_TK_2,24.249,28.361,"The invitation said, ""Tuesday's getting married, rehearsal's Friday, wedding's Saturday."" People were like, ""We gotta be there Monday for this wedding?"
Nate_Bargatze_TK_2,37.646,39.765,I look like I work there. -Uh... Everybody else just has a football or basketball jersey on.
Nate_Bargatze_TK_2,50.124,51.042,"No shirt. They forgot his shirt, and instead of waiting to go get it, he was like, ""Let's do it without it."""
Nate_Bargatze_TK_2,64.18,65.875,"He has a body that you're like, ""Put your jacket on backwards. Flip it around."""
Nate_Bargatze_TK_2,70.216,76.073,"Then you see his back, and you're like, ""Oof. All right, go back to regular way."
Russell_Peters,10.549,11.106,"He goes, look, you're a 48-year-old Indian man. I'm like, that's really fucking racist, but since you asked, I have acid reflux."
Russell_Peters,17.367,18.713,I don't know.
Russell_Peters,23.074,23.734,"Does anybody else- who else has acid reflux in here? First of all, you're lying to me right now."
Russell_Peters,38.771,41.336,"It's inevitable. There's no way you can consume the food that we eat with that much spice, and that much oil, and that much butter, and not just have it burn a hole in your- as my dad would say- your esophagus."
Russell_Peters,51.251,54.234,"No, no, son, esophagus. I don't care whose phagus you think this is."
Russell_Peters,70.283,71.202,"You do, do you. He's like, I know, I have it, but I don't want to say because my shirt looks like turmeric,"
Russell_Peters_2,17.69572953736655,19.65405693950178,"I was like, if I have twin girls- because you've got to have fun with the names. If I have twin girls, these are going to be my daughters, it's going to be Kate and Duplicate."
Russell_Peters_2,21.423629893238434,23.42914590747331,"These are my boys, it's Pete and Repeat."
Russell_Peters_2,25.576227758007118,27.227829181494663,"If I had twins with a black girl, this is Tyrone and Tyclone."
Russell_Peters_2,32.30060498220641,38.151992882562276,"That's your way of going, look. Look at how good my balls are."
Russell_Peters_2,50.0435231316726,51.12886120996441,"Or because you're Punjabi, look at how good my junk they are. Looks at this.Look at how good my balls are."
Russell_Peters_2,55.51740213523132,57.66448398576512,"My balls are so strong, they made one kid and then it made the exact same kid right away."
Russell_Peters_2,61.36879003558719,64.76637010676157,"You lift up your balls, sponsored by Xerox. Sponsored by Xerox."
Sam_Morril,9.583,15.102,"Obviously, it was an accident. No one at the party was like I'm gonna roofie that hairy boy over there."
Sam_Morril,21.481,25.54,I just told a room full of people I got roofied. I did not see one concerned face in here.
Sam_Morril,28.657,30.06,"Everyone in here is like I assume things worked out for you, and they did. Still weird, though."
Sam_Morril,43.711,47.941,"And then I chugged it, and I woke up the next morning, and I was like oh. That guy's a sexual predator."
Sam_Morril,51.8923,53.855,"And my friend said you ruined his night. And I was like, that's not how I want to think about it, you know?"
Sam_Morril,56.099,57.642,You don't want to think of yourself as a -block to some monster.
Sam_Morril,59.629,64.21,I prefer to think of myself as an accidental hero.
Sam_Morril,67.623,68.021,"Statistically, you know... I can't, you guys."
Sam_Morril,78.3,80.526,"It's kind of like if I was driving drunk and I just swerved and accidentally hit a mugger. And some woman is like, ""My hero,"" and I'm like if you say so, but I might have a substance abuse problem, so..."
Sam_Morril,107.6833,109.114,"I was like, yeah, that's a very helpful example. That's always the crossroads I find myself at at 4:57 a.m."
Sam_Morril,114.186,115.612,I can't tell you how often I'm coming out of a blackout like I should have done doubles instead. That's...
Sam_Morril,123.0456,124.653,"You tell me to replace an addiction with cardio, that's very helpful. I'm gonna start walking into halfway houses full of crack heads like have you guys done Zumba?"
Sam_Morril,128.258,129.497,It's so much better than crack.
Sam_Morril,135.364,136.509,"They're like, thanks, we didn't know. That was helpful."
Sam_Morril,140.389,143.171,Of course you want to get fucked up. Have you tried living?
Sam_Morril,160.609,162.035,"Good people just don't listen to them. If I listened to all the voices in my head, I would be a sometimes-gay street fighter, so..."
Sam_Morril,178.233,179.776,Why is E. Honda butt-fucking me? Wow.
Sam_Morril_2,33.412824933687006,36.803209549071624,"A hot girl walks up to a guy in the bar and asks to bum a cigarette, and he goes, oh, I don't smoke. So then she goes outside and bums them from another guy, and they go home together and they fuck and that's the whole commercial."
Sam_Morril_2,40.10006631299735,43.25663129973476,"There at the end, it just says, ""Wouldn't kill you to carry a pack,"" you know?"
Sam_Morril_2,49.85034482758621,55.50877984084881,"All right, I got some momentum. Let's break out the abortion jokes."
Sam_Morril_2,63.248209549071625,64.65112732095491,"She's going through it, yeah. That's not a very noble stance, I don't think."
Sam_Morril_2,69.79515915119364,70.47323607427056,"I'm like, guy should pay a little bit for the abortion, and women are like, he's a hero. He really is."
Sam_Morril_2,79.31161803713529,80.69115384615385,"That was the baby's name, Chivalry. I'm just saying."
Sam_Morril_2,83.6840450928382,85.62474801061009,"That one's not for everybody, that joke. I did that joke the other night and somebody yelled out boo."
Sam_Morril_2,91.65729442970823,94.6735676392573,"I thought it was the baby's ghost, but, you know. I'm just saying there are still gentlemen."
Sam_Morril_2,100.19171087533158,102.55328912466845,"If I knock you up and you need an abortion, it's on the house."
Sam_Morril_2,104.61090185676395,106.3177851458886,I'll throw my Delta SkyMiles card right on the counter.
Sam_Morril_2,108.51568965517242,110.08228116710876,"Are you sure, Sam? I got this."
Sam_Morril_2,112.65429708222813,116.27850132625996,"With all the rewards and benefits that Delta has to offer, I'd be a fool to do otherwise."
Sam_Morril_2,118.2659681697613,122.35781167108755,"I'm two to three abortions away from Diamond Medallion status, so..."
Sam_Morril_2,123.97116710875333,127.26802387267907,"I'm losing some of you, but I'm gonna take it a step further here."
Sam_Morril_2,143.12099469496022,143.56525198938994,"I think you should get extra SkyMiles points with an abortion, because that's one less crying baby onboard, you know? That, yeah, I don't... Me personally, I don't like doing that part of the joke, but I have a sponsorship deal with Delta, and you know, they get very upset when I leave it out."
Sam_Morril_2,147.42327586206898,149.78485411140585,They dock me Biscoff cookies.
Sam_Morril_2,157.26708222811672,166.058700265252,"He told me there was gonna be an anti-abortion parade, which I think he meant to say march, you know? I don't think there's gonna be a parade, but if there is, I'll be there."
Sam_Morril_2,169.49584880636607,173.68122015915122,"That one looks unfinished. That's what we're going for, so, yeah."
Trevor_Noah,28.251,30.529,"I, uh- I'm not particularly comfortable in the house at night by myself. What I'm trying to say is I'm afraid of the dark."
Trevor_Noah,37.232,40.139,"And I know it's stupid to be afraid of the dark, right? Because there's nothing there, nine times out of ten."
Trevor_Noah,64.336,67.965,Or do I leave the lights off and shit myself? I never know which one to go with.
Trevor_Noah,75.587,82.391,"But what I started doing now is I leave the lights off. And when I go the bathroom, I just speak to myself in a Russian accent."
Trevor_Noah,84.612,86.553,"I feel like I'm the most dangerous thing in the night. You'll find me at three a.m., barefoot, walking to the toilet, like, ""Yes."
Trevor_Noah,90.69,95.057,Big boy got to make a pee-pee. No trouble over here.
Trevor_Noah,101.726,105.023,"I feel safe, like even if there's a monster under the bed, he'd be like, ""Is that a Russian?"" There's just something about that Russian accent."
Trevor_Noah,174.178,175.568,"As soon as he says, ""Don't be such a bitch!"" Just be like... [Russian accent] ""You want to see bitch?"""
Trevor_Noah_2,13.273,17.662,"You are destined for greatness. You can't be running in the streets: ""And a Kit Kat, please."""
Trevor_Noah_2,26.474,27.698,"""I'm not telling you."" [laughs] It just doesn't work."
Trevor_Noah_2,38.852,40.535,"I remember when Nelson Mandela was still alive, and he would tell jokes at press conferences and events, and no one would laugh. Because everyone thought a man who had been in jail for 27 years couldn't make a joke."
Trevor_Noah_2,49.724,51.042,"It was partly because of that voice. He would tell the joke, and it would just sound too epic for people to laugh."
Trevor_Noah_2,60.423,62.326,"Let him in!"" ""No."
Trevor_Noah_2,74.216,78.397,"Who are we?' Oh, my God!"""
Tom_Segura,22.42,25.351,"This dude's like, ""You trying to get a sack?"" -I was like, ""Oh, shit."
Tom_Segura,31.113,32.456,"And he goes, ""We just need to go get it."" I was like, ""You don't fuckin' have it?"
Tom_Segura,43.95,46.023,"You stay here and watch my place."" And I was like..."
Tom_Segura,56.503,58.176,Inside? Paralysis.
Tom_Segura,61.4021,63.451,"But what I said was, ""That's what's up."" -Like, yeah, man."
Tom_Segura_2,44.776,47.44,"-And you hit that. And then you see it close, and you're like..."
Tom_Segura_2,50.788,53.995,"Sometimes, a second later it opens, and you're like, ""Fuck!"""
Tom_Segura_2,58.97,60.597,"You get nervous energy, like you're a kid. You're like, ""I'm in trouble."""

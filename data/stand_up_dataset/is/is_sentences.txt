And you start talking, maybe you have some drinks, maybe you dance, maybe you exchange numbers, maybe you start to date.
Now, I happen to think the very beginning of a new relationship is the most exciting part of the relationship.
Granted, I'm not married yet, so, technically, I've only had beginnings of relationships.
I don't know.
I can't say empirically how fun being married is.
I'll tell you on the next comedy special what that's all about.
But I don't know.
The beginning of a relationship is exciting because it's brand new.
You're both on your best behavior, it's still electric, you're not totally sure about the history of mental illness in each family.
It's fun.
And the most nerve-wracking part of a new relationship when you're younger, is the first time a boy comes over to your apartment.
'Cause it's ostensibly like your girlfriend audition time.
You want him to come in and be, like, "It's so homey.
I'd like to stay forever."
Yes, come closer.
Like, that's what you want.
You try so hard in your 20s, right?
Because you're young, and it's fun.
That's your 20s.
In your 30s...
In your 30s, homeboy knocks on the door, you open it, you're in combat boots, nothing else, and a garbage can on fire, you're, like, "Welcome to Fuckdome, Scott."
Ticket?
Okay, so...
But it's interesting, in your 20s, it's a weird mental game.
Boy's coming over for the first time, you're trying to reconcile the beautiful home that your mother kept that you lived in growing up, with the beautiful home that, like, Pinterest says you're supposed to have.
And the fact that you have no fucking money, so... Should I buy a rug or eat dinner?
I don't know.
It's so hard.

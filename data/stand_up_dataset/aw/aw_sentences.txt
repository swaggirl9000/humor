The last time I was at home in San Francisco, I was trying to help her get rid of shit.
Don't ever do that with your mom.
It was like the worst experience of my life.
It was so emotional.
We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82... manual.
The manual.
She don't even know... where the calculator is.
Those of you under 25 probably don't know what that calculator is.
It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation.
We were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade.
It cost like $200.
And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson's laptop from the future.
All because what?
It could graph.
It was like the Tesla of my time.
And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, "You never know when you might need this."
And I was like, "But...
I do know... that I'm gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die."
"And I'm not trying to be a procrastinator anymore.
Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that's not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success."

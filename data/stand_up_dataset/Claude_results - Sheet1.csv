Ali_Wong,Don't ever do that with your mom. It was like the worst experience of my life.

Chelsea_Peretti,"She calls him her 'hubby,' which, to me is on par with the 'N' word. Like let's… Let's eradicate both."
Chelsea_Peretti,"My hubby made breakfast. My hubby fixed the door. My hubby is sleeping. He breathed in, he breathed out. He breathed in, he breathed out."
Chelsea_Peretti,My hubby shot himself in the face! His letter said he missed his name… which I just found out is Steven. Missing my hub like a mug
Trevor_Noah_2,"You can't be running in the streets: 'And a Kit Kat, please.' No. No."

Trevor_Noah_2,"Ah, knock, knock.' People would be like, 'Let him in. Let him in!"
Trevor_Noah_2,"No. No, no. You must say, 'Who's there?'' 'He is so right. We've always got to ask, 'Who's there?' Who's here? Who are we?' Oh, my God!"
Trevor_Noah_2,"It was because of that voice, the first black president voice"

Anthony_Jeselnik,My mom actually should've been on one of the planes that crashed on 9/11. I think.
Anthony_Jeselnik,My mom could be very racist. Very racist. And I do not tolerate racism. That's ignorance and I hate that.
Anthony_Jeselnik,"Anthony, who's your new friend? Is he a drug dealer?"" And I would say, ""Shut up, Mom, that's racist. Put your money away."
Anthony_Jeselnik,"Most of them are in jail, to be honest. And we never talk, write letters or any of that shit. 'Cause they're all in jail for the exact same thing. My testimony."

Joe_List,"I'm Bill, this is Susan, and Ted. Ear, nose, throat. Who do ya need?"
Joe_List,This guy's a fake ass fucking retard doctor. It's pronounced t-ah-n-i-tus.
Joe_List,"This gentlemen is a doctor, he seems very smart. This fella seems, less smart, but, extremely adamant about the pronunciation of this word."
Joe_List,"If you have it, don't go to the doctor, they don't do shit."
Joe_List,"My hearing is great. I hear everything, plus ringing, so. I kind of have superpower hearing, if you think about it. I'm hearing shit that's not even in the room."

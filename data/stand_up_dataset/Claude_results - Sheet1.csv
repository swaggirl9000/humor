Jimmy_Yang,"Asian people, we don’t need Tinder anymore. We just go to BTS concerts. That’s how we do that parking lot pimping."
Jimmy_Yang,"I’ve been dating a lot of tall girls lately, because it makes me look successful. "
Jimmy_Yang,"Why the fuck are you wearing heels? She's like, it makes my ass look better. I'm like, your ass is at my eye level right now. Neither of us look good, OK? I look like a child, and you look like a child molester."
Jimmy_Yang,I'm 5′ 5″. I just go to concerts to smell other people's armpits.
Jimmy_Yang,"Pick me up. This is bullshit. I paid for these tickets, OK? I want to see Billy Eilish, too."
Russell_Peters,"You're a 48-year-old Indian man. I'm like, that's really fucking racist, but since you asked, I have acid reflux."
Russell_Peters,There is no way you can be Indian and not have fucking acid reflux. It's inevitable.
Russell_Peters,"There's no way you can consume the food that we eat with that much spice, and that much oil, and that much butter, and not just have it burn a hole in your– as my dad would say– your esophagus."
Russell_Peters,"Dad, I want to assure you I have no phagus in me. No, no, son, esophagus. I don't care whose phagus you think this is."
Russell_Peters,"He's like, I know, I have it, but I don't want to say because my shirt looks like turmeric."
John_Mulaney,"And then one day my wife said, 'Hey, you took that stuff to Goodwill, right?' And I said, 'Of course I did! On an unrelated note, I'm going to walk out the front door right now.'"
John_Mulaney,"It was charitable, but it was also fast and violent, because I was throwing boxes at people."
John_Mulaney,"Dear IRS, please deduct from my federal income tax one XXL Billabong T-shirt from youth. It was too big. My mom said it could be a sleep shirt."
John_Mulaney,"So rather than violate these meaningless politeness rules, I'll just go to bed in a smock like goddamn Ebenezer Scrooge."
John_Mulaney,Why don't you give me a candle for looking in the mirror and a floppy hat and I'll tremble off to bed in my long Victorian nightgown?
Ali_Wong,Don't ever do that with your mom. It was like the worst experience of my life.
Ali_Wong,We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82... manual. The manual. She don't even know... where the calculator is.
Ali_Wong,It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation.
Ali_Wong,It was like the Tesla of my time.
Ali_Wong,You never know when you might need this.
Ali_Wong,But... I do know... that I'm gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.
Ali_Wong,"And I'm not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that's not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success."
Hasan_Minhaj,Do you know when br0wn kids get slapped? Every br0wn birthday party.
Hasan_Minhaj,"And usually it's the kid whose birthday it is, and we stand there and point and laugh. We go, 'Ah, Biju got slapped on his birthday!"
Hasan_Minhaj,"That's what makes us tough and resilient. It's why we become cardiologists and win spelling bees."""
Hasan_Minhaj,You ever seen an Indian kid win a spelling bee? Incredible! Ice water in the veins.
Hasan_Minhaj,That kid won't choke on camera. He's been slapped on camera.
Hasan_Minhaj,Of course he can spell 'knaidel'.
Hasan_Minhaj,"Look at that face. Nothing. Nothing! He's 12 years old. Nothing! This kid just won $30,000 cash. Nothing."
Hasan_Minhaj,"His brother is like, 'I'm fucked. I'm fucked. The bar is way too high. I should kill myself.'"
Hasan_Minhaj,That is an Indian sociopath.

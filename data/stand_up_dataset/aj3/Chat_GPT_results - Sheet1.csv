Jimmy_Yang,"Asian people, we don’t need Tinder anymore. We just go to BTS concerts. That’s how we do that parking lot pimping."
Jimmy_Yang,"I’ve been dating a lot of tall girls lately, because it makes me look successful. No, no. I think tall women are beautiful. But some of them like to wear heels. That’s just disrespect. Like, you’re already five inches taller than me. Why the fuck are you wearing heels?"
Jimmy_Yang,"She’s like, it makes my ass look better. I’m like, your ass is at my eye level right now. Neither of us look good, OK? I look like a child, and you look like a child molester."
Jimmy_Yang,"Last time– the last time I took a tall girl to this concert– I don’t know if you guys know this, but apparently, tall people have fun at concerts. Are you guys aware of that?"
Jimmy_Yang,I’m 5′ 5″. I just go to concerts to smell other people’s armpits. I’m like what the fuck’s the point of this?
Jimmy_Yang,"She was having the time of her life, doing whatever tall people do at concerts, you know, jumping around, obstructing other people’s views, seeing everything."
Jimmy_Yang,"I was frustrated. I had enough. So I just looked up at her, I was like, hey! Pick me up. This is bullshit. I paid for these tickets, OK? I want to see Billy Eilish, too. Come on."
Russell_Peters,"He goes, look, you’re a 48-year-old Indian man. I’m like, that’s really fucking racist, but since you asked, I have acid reflux."
Russell_Peters,There is no way you can be Indian and not have fucking acid reflux. It’s inevitable.
Russell_Peters,"There’s no way you can consume the food that we eat with that much spice, and that much oil, and that much butter, and not just have it burn a hole in your– as my dad would say– your esophagus."
Russell_Peters,"Dad, I want to assure you I have no phagus in me. No, no, son, esophagus. I don’t care whose phagus you think this is."
Russell_Peters,"I’m looking at all of you, especially all the pudgy guys. You know exactly who has it. You got it, don’t you, yellow guy? You do, do you. He’s like, I know, I have it, but I don’t want to say because my shirt looks like turmeric."
John_Mulaney,"We made these big piles of clothes, we put the piles into these big boxes, then we put the boxes into the back of my car, and then they stayed there for four months."
John_Mulaney,"One day my wife said, 'Hey, you took that stuff to Goodwill, right?' And I said, 'Of course I did! On an unrelated note, I’m going to walk out the front door right now.'"
John_Mulaney,"It was charitable, but it was also fast and violent, because I was throwing boxes at people."
John_Mulaney,"The boxes were so heavy I couldn’t even say what was in them. I was like, 'This one’s shirts. I got a bunch of shirts! Take ’em away!"
John_Mulaney,"The guy tried to give me a big receipt. He’s like, 'Take this receipt for the clothing for your taxes.' How do I write that on my taxes? 'Dear IRS, please deduct from my federal income tax one XXL Billabong T-shirt from youth. It was too big. My mom said it could be a sleep shirt. Please deduct this from my 2017 income.'"
John_Mulaney,"That sleep shirt bullshit. 'Well, if it’s too big you can just wear it as a sleep shirt.' No, I get that, Mom, but why don’t we just tell our relatives that I’m a four-year-old boy and I don’t wear a man’s XXL T-shirt?"
John_Mulaney,"Because we don’t say that when someone gives us a gift because that would not be polite.' Oh, I get it. So rather than violate these meaningless politeness rules, I’ll just go to bed in a smock like goddamn Ebenezer Scrooge."
John_Mulaney,Why don’t you give me a candle for looking in the mirror and a floppy hat and I’ll tremble off to bed in my long Victorian nightgown?
John_Mulaney,"Was there ever even a ghost, Mother, or was the dead Victorian girl you saw just me all along?"
Ali_Wong,"The last time I was at home in San Francisco, I was trying to help her get rid of shit. Don't ever do that with your mom. It was like the worst experience of my life."""
Ali_Wong,It was so emotional. We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82... manual. The manual. She don't even know... where the calculator is.
Ali_Wong,Those of you under 25 probably don't know what that calculator is. It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eighth grade. It cost like $200.
Ali_Wong,And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson's laptop from the future. All because what? It could graph. It was like the Tesla of my time.
Ali_Wong,"And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, 'You never know when you might need this.'"
Ali_Wong,"And I was like, 'But... I do know... that I'm gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.'"
Ali_Wong,"And I'm not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that's not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success."
Hasan_Minhaj,Have you seen the show called The Slap? This is a real show on NBC. This is a real show about a white kid that gets slapped at a birthday party. Are you fucking kidding? Thirteen episodes for this kid? Are you kidding me?
Hasan_Minhaj,"Do you know when brown kids get slapped? Every brown birthday party. And usually it’s the kid whose birthday it is, and we stand there and point and laugh. We go, 'Ah, Biju got slapped on his birthday!'"
Hasan_Minhaj,And that’s what makes us tough and resilient. It’s why we become cardiologists and win spelling bees. Slapping is important. It elevates your game.
Hasan_Minhaj,You ever seen an Indian kid win a spelling bee? Incredible! Ice water in the veins. That kid won’t choke on camera. He’s been slapped on camera.
Hasan_Minhaj,"Of course he can spell 'knaidel'. Knaidel. Look at that face. Nothing. Nothing! He’s 12 years old. Nothing! This kid just won $30,000 cash. Nothing"
Hasan_Minhaj,"People ask, 'Where does that come from?' Look at this kid’s parents. Your son just won the Scripps National Spelling Bee. Look at his brother. His brother is like, 'I’m fucked. I’m fucked. The bar is way too high. I should kill myself.'"
Hasan_Minhaj,"People say, 'Where’s Bobby Jindal from?' That’s where he comes from. That is an Indian sociopath."
Chelsea_Peretti,"It’s like that wedding portraiture, where it’s just like, two assholes back to back in the woods, just like… [laughing shrilly] 'To the future!'"
Chelsea_Peretti,"I’m just obsessed with the entire photoset. I’m just like, 'Next, next, next, next, more, more, more, more.'"
Chelsea_Peretti,"Every photo, they were just like… [giggles shrilly] 'Uh-oh, it’s us again.' [trills]"
Chelsea_Peretti,"She calls him her 'hubby,' which, to me is on par with the 'N' word. Like let’s… Let’s eradicate both."
Chelsea_Peretti,"All her updates, she’s just like, 'My hubby made breakfast. My hubby fixed the door. My hubby is sleeping. He breathed in, he breathed out. He breathed in, he breathed out.'"
Chelsea_Peretti,My hubby shot himself in the face! His letter said he missed his name… which I just found out is Steven.'
Chelsea_Peretti,Missing my hub like a mug
Trevor_Noah_2,"You can’t be running in the streets: 'And a Kit Kat, please.' No. No. It’s so unique. You can’t be silly."
Trevor_Noah_2,"What are you making, prank phone calls? 'Who the hell is this?!' 'I’m not telling you.'"
Trevor_Noah_2,"I remember when Nelson Mandela was still alive, and he would tell jokes at press conferences and events, and no one would laugh. Because everyone thought a man who had been in jail for 27 years couldn’t make a joke."
Trevor_Noah_2,"He would tell the joke, and it would just sound too epic for people to laugh. Everything he did, he’d just be like, 'Ah, knock, knock.' People would be like, 'Let him in. Let him in!"
Trevor_Noah_2,"‘No. No, no. You must say, ‘Who’s there?' ‘He is so right. We’ve always got to ask, ‘Who’s there?’ Who’s here? Who are we? Oh, my God!’"
Joe_List,"I was hoping it was three doctors saving money, by sharing a small office. He’s like, 'I’m Bill, this is Susan, and Ted. Ear, nose, throat. Who do ya need?' And they all kinda."
Joe_List,"I thought it was called tinnitus, but then I watched a YouTube video, and the doctor in the video, he kept saying 'tin-uh-dus.' But then I went to the comments section, and the first comment said, 'This guy’s a fake ass fucking retard doctor. It’s pronounced t-ah-n-i-tus.' All caps."
Joe_List,"This gentleman is a doctor, he seems very smart. This fella seems, less smart, but, extremely adamant about the pronunciation of this word."
Joe_List,"Tomato, to-mah-to. However you say it. If you have it, don’t go to the doctor, they don’t do shit."
Joe_List,"""I was like 'Doc, I have uh, tinnitus, or tin-uh-dus. Whatever you guys are calling it. My ears are ringing.' And then he said, 'Okay, I’m gonna test your hearing.' And I was like, 'Oh no, that’s okay. My hearing is great. I hear everything, plus ringing, so.'"
Joe_List,"I kind of have superpower hearing, if you think about it. I’m hearing shit that’s not even in the room.'"
Anthony_Jeselnik,"So poor I remember, just so I could go to my senior prom, I had to sell my U.S. passport on the street. Sold my passport on the street for 300 bucks to get to go to my prom"
Anthony_Jeselnik,"Of course this was before 9/11 so… my bad, everybody."
Anthony_Jeselnik,"Weird joke to clap for, but sure."
Anthony_Jeselnik,My mom actually should’ve been on one of the planes that crashed on 9/11. I think.
Anthony_Jeselnik,My mom could be very racist. Very racist. And I do not tolerate racism. That’s ignorance and I hate that
Anthony_Jeselnik,"Once in a while, I’d bring a black friend over. And when I did that, my mom would act weird. She’d pull me aside and say, ‘Anthony, who’s your new friend? Is he a drug dealer?’ And I would say, ‘Shut up, Mom, that’s racist. Put your money away.’"
Anthony_Jeselnik,"Most of them are in jail, to be honest. And we never talk, write letters or any of that shit. ‘Cause they’re all in jail for the exact same thing. My testimony."
Sam_Morril_2,"It’s weird that they can do anti-smoking ads, but you can’t do pro-cigarette commercials. Isn’t that weird? They don’t give ’em a rebuttal."
Sam_Morril_2,"I thought of a good pro-cigarette commercial... A hot girl walks up to a guy in the bar and asks to bum a cigarette, and he goes, oh, I don’t smoke. So then she goes outside and bums them from another guy, and they go home together and they fuck and that’s the whole commercial."
Sam_Morril_2,"There at the end, it just says, ‘Wouldn’t kill you to carry a pack.’ Marlboro: Just in Case."
Sam_Morril_2,"My friend just had one [an abortion], and her boyfriend didn’t contribute to the cost, which I thought was not cool, you know? That is how low the bar is. I’m like, guy should pay a little bit for the abortion, and women are like, he’s a hero."
Sam_Morril_2,"No, even the most pro-life person I talk to was like, wow, chivalry is dead. That was the baby’s name, Chivalry."
Sam_Morril_2,"I thought it was the baby’s ghost, but, you know. I’m just saying there are still gentlemen."
Sam_Morril_2,"If I knock you up and you need an abortion, it’s on the house. I’ll throw my Delta SkyMiles card right on the counter."
Sam_Morril_2,"With all the rewards and benefits that Delta has to offer, I’d be a fool to do otherwise. I’m two to three abortions away from Diamond Medallion status."
Sam_Morril_2,"I think you should get extra SkyMiles points with an abortion, because that’s one less crying baby onboard, you know?"
Sam_Morril_2,They dock me Biscoff cookies. Love those cookies.
Sam_Morril_2,"He told me there was gonna be an anti-abortion parade, which I think he meant to say march, you know? I don’t think there’s gonna be a parade, but if there is, I’ll be there. I want to see what the floats look like. That one looks unfinished."
Anthony_Jeselnik_2,I’ve never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money. How should I handle this?
Anthony_Jeselnik_2,Just go up there and tell a story. Find one moment about you and your grandma you can share with everybody. And don’t tell a joke. Try not to.
Anthony_Jeselnik_2,"And I know my grandma loved it too, because it combined her two favorite things: spending time with her grandchildren, and using the ‘N’ word."
Anthony_Jeselnik_2,I promise you… until you’ve heard your grandfather gasp at his own wife’s funeral… you are not a real comedian.
Anthony_Jeselnik_2,I am a real comedian. I am a pure comedian. I think I’m one of the best comedians of all time.
Anthony_Jeselnik_3,My mom and dad once made me smoke an entire pack of cigarettes. An entire pack of cigarettes in one sitting. Just to teach me an important lesson about brand loyalty.
Anthony_Jeselnik_3,"The first time I ever got a bad report card in school, I brought it home, I gave it to my dad, and my dad beat me. Beat the hell out of me."
Anthony_Jeselnik_3,My dad was a hard-ass. One of those guys who believed that men just learn by doing things. You know? You don’t take classes. You don’t read the instructions. You just do it and figure it out.
Anthony_Jeselnik_3,"When I was a kid, I never got to take swimming lessons. No, my dad would pick me up and throw me in the water to teach himself CPR."
Ali_Wong_2,I need to have children to keep me company when I get older. It’s lonely.
Ali_Wong_2,"My mom is 80, going through a full-blown mid-life crisis. ‘Cause she knows that she’s got a century more to go."
Ali_Wong_2,"And she is so lonely. All of her white friends, dead. Her Mexican friends, dead. Black friends, dead. I’m just kidding. She doesn’t have any black friends."
Ali_Wong_2,"Life is not Rush Hour, the movie, OK?"
Ali_Wong_2,"I need children to be there for me when I’m older, when I get as old as her. And when I say be there for me, I mean pay for me when my husband isn’t around to support me anymore."
Ali_Wong_2,"I’m not trying to be one of those old Chinese ladies who recycles for a living. That’s not my destiny, OK?"
Ali_Wong_2,"Old Chinese ladies, they don’t give a fuck. They got no shame. They’re like, ‘I’m just gonna recycle… go bald… go to the park, do this shit.’"
Ali_Wong_2,They do that ’cause it’s a free activity. For them.
Ali_Wong_2,"They do it in their big-ass V. Stiviano visor, their Darth Vader-Tomb Raider-Boba Fett helmet."
Ali_Wong_2,"They wear that to protect themselves from their arch-nemesis, the sun. They’re in a contest to see who’s gonna burn out first."
Ali_Wong_2,Old Asian ladies and the sun are like the Tupac and Biggie of longevity.
Ali_Wong_3,"My husband is Asian. Which a lot of people are shocked by, because, usually, Asian-American women who, like, you know, wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions, they like to date white dudes."
Ali_Wong_3,You go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in America and that shit is turning into a Yoko Ono factory.
Ali_Wong_3,"I get it, you know, because being with a white dude you feel very… You feel very picturesque when you’re with a white dude, you know. You feel like you’re in a Wes Anderson movie or something."
Ali_Wong_3,"White dudes, they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling, and disturbing documentaries."
Ali_Wong_3,"Nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy. Oh, my God. I just feel like I’m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement… …you know, just right there, through the money hole"
Ali_Wong_3,"And then also, he’s so vulnerable down there. I’m, like, 'I could just crush your head at any moment, white man! I could just kill you right now! Crush those brains! Colonize the colonizer!'"
Chelsea_Peretti_2,"If you really want to piss off a really hot girl, like a model-hot girl, go onto her social media, find a photo where she looks smoking hot, and you’re just a regular girl. Go onto her comments and just be like, ‘People say I look just like you.’ She’ll be like, ‘No!’"
Chelsea_Peretti_2,"Do you know that women Botox their armpits? This is an actual thing. It’s not to make them look youthful, you know. ‘Hi, everyone, same old me.’"
Chelsea_Peretti_2,"I met a girl who did it, and she was like, ‘It worked. I did stop sweating out of my armpits, but I started sweating out of my butthole.’"
Chelsea_Peretti_2,Then I’m imagining the guy that sees her out somewhere and is just like… ‘She is so fucking hot. Her armpits are bone-fucking-dry… just like I always dreamed of.’
Chelsea_Peretti_2,"Then he’s like, ‘Whoa, whoa, whoa!’ That’s him slipping on her butt sweat. ‘Whoa, whoa, whoa!’"
Chelsea_Peretti_2,This is a whole new kind of juicy booty.
Chelsea_Peretti_3,My dick hurts.
Chelsea_Peretti_3,"""‘Cause I wanted it to be cross-platform, you know? I didn’t know if they were linked."""
Chelsea_Peretti_3,"""Dude, what’s up with your dick? We’re worried about you."""
Chelsea_Peretti_3,"""E equals… I’m not sure yet."""
Chelsea_Peretti_3,"""What’s up, Jew-fro?! You Jew-ass bitch! Jew, Jew, Jew, bitch, Jew, bitch, Jew."""
Chelsea_Peretti_3,"""Oh, I’m not gonna do science anymore. It’s too hurtful."""
Chelsea_Peretti_3,"""Maybe get a job at Kiehl’s."""
Chelsea_Peretti_3,"""Did he use beakers? I don’t know. Like, what did he do? He invented wing sauce?"""
Donald_Glover,"""Tears streaming down his face, but he wasn’t crying. He wasn’t crying. Just tears, he was giving me this mean mug."""
Donald_Glover,"""The sweetest thing he was allowed was mints. He was just allowed to have mints. So he would steal mints by the handful."""
Donald_Glover,"""His breath was so fresh… the vapors from his own mouth made his eyes water."""
Donald_Glover,"""He’d be like, 'Hello!' And then like… Just, they would just bleed… It was crazy."""
Donald_Glover,"""All the babysitters in New York for some reason are Trinidadian. They’re all Trinidadian babysitters."""
Donald_Glover,"""We’d trade jerk-chicken recipes and stuff."""
Donald_Glover,"""He wanted to get to his slide, so he just pushed over this little girl."""
Donald_Glover,"""Don’t you talk to me like that, I am a grown-up, you will respect me."""
Donald_Glover,"""Suck my d!ck!"""
Donald_Glover,"""Someone betta get this little niglet away from me."""
Donald_Glover_2,"“Yeah, well, if anybody ever tries to rape me, I’m just gonna shit on ’em.”"
Donald_Glover_2,"“Two things, lady. Number one, he’s a rapist. So his tolerance for gross stuff is probably pretty high. It’s probably pretty high.”"
Donald_Glover_2,"“Number two… you can shit on command? Like, you can just… You can just poop whenever you want to? Just be like… Hyah! He’s like, ‘Oh God, no!’”"
Donald_Glover_2,"“You’re a national treasure. Like, you can… You got more superpowers than Shaft if you can poop whenever you want.”"
Donald_Glover_2,"“Somebody can run down… down the stage right now and pull out a gun and be like, ‘Shit yourself! Poop yourself right now!’ I’d be like, ‘Blow my head off.’”"
Donald_Glover_2,"“Me and my butt are, like, always on the third date, I feel like. I feel like, me, I’m always like, come on, let’s… hurry up, let’s do this. And my butt’s always like, stop rushing me, when the time is right.”"
Donald_Glover_3,"""People always want to know who can say the N-word and who can’t say the N-word."""
Donald_Glover_3,"""I’ve got a lot of white friends. And they’re all just kind of like, 'Oh man, I wish I could say that stuff. It sounds so cool when you say it in rap songs. Like, I want to say that, it sounds cool.'"""
Donald_Glover_3,"""It still comes up in weird places, like… You know, like that niglet joke?"""
Donald_Glover_3,"""I told that joke in Alaska, and Alaska, for some reason, has a large deaf population."""
Donald_Glover_3,"""She comes up to me and she goes, 'I’m sorry, but are there any terms or phrases in your act that don’t exist in sign language that I have to make up on the spot?' And I was like… 'Yeah. Niglet?'"""
Donald_Glover_3,"""Deaf people have been saying 'niglet' for years!"""
Donald_Glover_3,"""A n*gga that is tiny, that’s what that means!"""
Donald_Glover_3,"""Why is this 'n*gga'? Why is this… This is… I feel like it should be…"""
Donald_Glover_3,"""Way, way before this. I’ve done this walking down the street. Like, when my nose itches, I’ve done that and I feel like deaf people were looking at me like, 'That motherfucker’s racist.'"""
Hasan_Minhaj_2,"""Alright, you guys are all killing it academically but I want you to know there is more to life than just getting into UC Berkeley."""
Hasan_Minhaj_2,"One kid was like, “I know, getting into Stanford.”"

Hasan_Minhaj_3,"“I’m picking up soda and I’m like, ‘Ah!’ ‘Don’t do that.’ ‘I’m going to live forever!’ Then I would trip on my Velcro shoes and I would drop the soda and it would explode.”"
Hasan_Minhaj_3,“And then my dad would do what most br0wn parents do. He would check to see if the coast is clear… and he’d slap the shit out of me.”
Hasan_Minhaj_3,“Immigrants aren’t going to hit their children the way you do. Americans hit on the arm and bruise the body. Immigrants slap your face and bruise your soul. It’s Guantanamo of the mind.”

Trevor_Noah_3,"""You must remember, I come from an African country. And all over Africa, we have traffic lights. But we don’t use them. All right? It’s less of a command and more of a suggestion. It’s not 'Stop!' It’s 'Stop?'"""
Trevor_Noah_3,"""Because I’ve come to realize, in America, if you got the white man on your side, you can do whatever you like."""
Trevor_Noah_3,"""It’s almost like an African traveled the world, saw that other people have traffic lights and then just brought them back, but didn’t know what they were for. The guy was like, 'Guys, guys, guys. We need to get traffic lights. Ah?' People were like, 'What for?' 'It’s for the intersection. It adds atmosphere.'"""
Trevor_Noah_3,"""After eight blocks, it was the only way I knew how to live. I had my phone out. I was tweeting and texting. I didn’t play games. I’d be looking down, look up. The light would change, and I was out!"""
Trevor_Noah_3,"""In New York– I’ve never seen it– people trust that light with their lives."""
Trevor_Noah_3,"""I started that day… thinking and pondering before stepping out. And after a few blocks with him, I started believing."""
Trevor_Noah_3,"""Instinctively, I stuck my hand out to protect him. I was like, 'Yo, dude, there’s a truck.' And he was like, 'It’s okay. We’ve got the light.' I said, 'Yeah, and he has a truck. In a game of rock-paper-scissors, you lose.'"""
Trevor_Noah_3,"""I walked with that man for 12 blocks. And let me tell you, I have never been imbued with the confidence of another human being the way I was with him."""
Trevor_Noah_3,"""He walked out. He didn’t just walk out. He stared that truck driver down as he was crossing. Just looking at him. Like, 'I’ve got the light. You know I’ve got the light. You know I’ve got that light.'"""
Trevor_Noah_3,"""I was running behind him, all apologetic. 'I’m sorry, I didn’t know. He– I’m sorry. I would have stopped– I’ve never done this before.'"""

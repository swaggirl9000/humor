A friend of a friend just posted like 500 engagement photos on Facebook.
It was a photoset of 500 photos.
I'm not exaggerating.
It's like that wedding portraiture, where it's just like, two assholes back to back in the woods, just like... [laughing shrilly] "To the future!"
I'm just obsessed with the entire photoset.
I'm just like, "Next, next, next, next, more, more, more, more."
Every photo, they were just like... [giggles shrilly] "Uh-oh, it's us again."
[trills] This same girl on Facebook, all her posts and all her updates are about her husband.
That's all she seems to write or think about, but she doesn't call him her husband, which would be awesome, and she doesn't call him by his name, which would also be great.
She calls him by a word that I really feel is one of the more disgusting words in the English language.
She calls him her "hubby," which, to me is on par with the "N" word.
Like let's... Let's eradicate both.
All her updates, she's just like, "My hubby made breakfast.
My hubby fixed the door.
My hubby is sleeping.
He breathed in, he breathed out.
He breathed in, he breathed out."
I just keep waiting for the day where she is like, "My hubby shot himself in the face!
His letter said he missed his name... which I just found out is Steven.
Missing my hub like a mug."

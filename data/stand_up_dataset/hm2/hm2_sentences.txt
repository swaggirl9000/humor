Now, my AP Calc class was a group of overachievers and my Calc teacher, Mr Pendleton, wanted us to live lives outside of school.
So one day he gets up in front of the entire class.
"Alright, you guys are all killing it academically but I want you to know there is more to life than just getting into UC Berkeley."
One kid was like, "I know, getting into Stanford."
He's like, "No, you have to live a life worth talking about, which is why I'm making it mandatory for everyone in this class to go to prom."
I'm like, "All 30 of us?
We're all going to prom?
AP Calc?
Us?
Me, Jehovah's Witness girl, Korean exchange students, going to the prom?
Thirty for 30?
All of us?"
I'm laughing so hard, I'm crying.
He's like, "Hanson, this is not funny."
He walks over to the board, he pulls it down.
It's a bracket with everybody's name on it leading up to the big dance.
It's March Madness for nerds.
I'm like, "Whatever, it's not going to happen.
He can't do this."

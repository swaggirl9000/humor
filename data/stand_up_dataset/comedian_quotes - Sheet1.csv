Once in a while, I’d bring a black friend over. And when I did that, my mom would act weird. She’d pull me aside and say, ‘Anthony, who’s your new friend? Is he a drug dealer?’"
Anthony_Jeselnik_2,I've never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money. How should I handle this?
Anthony_Jeselnik_2,"You know what my favorite memory was? When I was like four years old, before I learned to read, Grandma would curl up with me on the couch, she had this Southern accent, and she would read to me. She would read Mark Twain to me, and I loved it."
Anthony_Jeselnik_2,"And I know my grandma loved it too, because it combined her two favorite things: spending time with her grandchildren, and using the ‘N’ word.’"

Chelsea_Peretti_2,"I'm so drawn to you, but I can't get near you! This is a whole new kind of juicy booty."
Chelsea_Peretti_2,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Donald_Glover,"I was like, what the fuck is wrong with this kid? What’s going on with this kid?"
Donald_Glover,The sweetest thing he was allowed was mints. He was just allowed to have mints.
Donald_Glover,"It was crazy. I would take him to the park, right? Washington Square Park, and all the babysitters in New York for some reason are Trinidadian. They’re all Trinidadian babysitters."

Hasan_Minhaj,It’s why we become cardiologists and win spelling bees.
Hasan_Minhaj,"That kid won $30,000 cash. Nothing."
Hasan_Minhaj_2,"Alright, you guys are all killing it academically but I want you to know there is more to life than just getting into UC Berkeley."
Hasan_Minhaj_2,"I know, getting into Stanford."

Jimmy_Yang_2,"It’s really hard for me to watch TV with my dad, because he’s trying to make me explain everything to him."
Jimmy_Yang_2,"Old Asian people, they don’t watch TV. They judge the TV."
Jimmy_Yang_2,"He’s just sitting there, arms folded, judging the TV like–He’s made some random noises around the house."
Jimmy_Yang_2,"Whenever he sneezes, it’s never just a sneeze. It’s like a whole tsunami of sound waves that comes after."

Louis_CK_2,They’re so stupid! Incredibly stupid animals

Nate_Bargatze,"I love having a kid. We… I love when kids cry, it’s just innocent."

Nate_Bargatze,It’s not on YouTube. Me and her mom are the only subscribers. She just watches kids playing with toys.
Nate_Bargatze_2,We’re doing homework too. Our daughter started bringing it home.
Nate_Bargatze_2,"Okay, learning it earlier than we used to, huh?"
Nate_Bargatze_2,It’s a whole new math. And the goal of Common Core is to use one sheet of paper for every problem.
Nate_Bargatze_2,Oh! Just do that at the top. I don’t even know what we’re doing.
Nate_Bargatze_2,It’s a long way to get at the same answer.

Russell_Peters_2,"If I have twin girls, these are going to be my daughters, it’s going to be Kate and Duplicate."
Russell_Peters_2,"These are my boys, it’s Pete and Repeat."
Russell_Peters_2,"If I had twins with a black girl, this is Tyrone and Tyclone."
Russell_Peters_2,"Identical twins, that’s like bragging rights for you, you know I mean"
Sam_Morril,"I got roofied at a party in college by accident, but you know, it still counts."
Sam_Morril,"That is male privilege right there, isn’t it? I just told a room full of people I got roofied. I did not see one concerned face in here."
Sam_Morril_2,"I did nothing all day, man. I did nothing. I watched the news. I saw an anti-smoking ad. It’s weird that they can do anti-smoking ads, but you can’t do pro-cigarette commercials."

Trevor_Noah,"""I feel safe, like even if there’s a monster under the bed, he’d be like, ‘Is that a Russian?’ There’s just something about that Russian accent. Ladies, every single one of you needs to learn the Russian accent."
Trevor_Noah_2,He could not be a normal man with a voice like that. You can’t do normal things with that voice. You are destined for greatness.
Trevor_Noah_2,"You can’t be running in the streets: “And a Kit Kat, please.” No. No. It’s so unique. You can’t be silly. What are you making, prank phone calls? “Who the hell is this?!” “I’m not telling you.” [laughs] It just doesn’t work"

Tom_Segura,"There\'s a .357 and a shotgun on my bed. Anybody comes in here, blast ’em."
Tom_Segura,"Can we get a description before we agree to terms? How about a height and weight on old mom?"""

Tom_Segura_2,"I was trying to figure out, “Why does this feel so good?” I think it’s a taste of power. Like most of us, we have no power in our everyday lives. But if you’re alone in an elevator, -you are lord of the elevator shaft. You get to decide, like a king with his drawbridge."

You don't want to wear... what you wore during the day.
Don't want work clothes.
You don't want to wear your daytime clothes, 'cause... 'cause it's nighttime.
What if that was the end of my show?
I hit my head.
You don't want to wear your civilian clothes, okay.
'Cause you had a whole day.
Maybe you sweat in them, they're gross.
However, at the other end of the sartorial spectrum, you don't want to go, like, super hardcore sexy the first time a guy's coming over.
Just relax.
You don't want to wear nipple tassels.
Now... some women are, like, "Wait a minute."
I am the woman that has stood here before and will stand here before you again and let you know you can wear whatever you want.
It doesn't give a man the right to put his hands on you.
No always means no.
That's like a boiler-plated given.
No means no.
Kindergarteners get it.
I don't know why we forget that as adult males, but... no means no.
This is less about that, and more about just being mentally kind to the other person.
You show up in that, he'll be, like, "Oh, my god!"
The blood's gonna go from here to his dick, he's gonna impale himself, he's gonna sue you, and you ain't got no money.
So... just be kind, because, mentally, it's like, "Maybe she wants me.
I don't know.
Oh, my god."
It's frustrating.
You know, girls, it'd be like if you have the worst day, you came home to your boyfriend, like... "I had the worst day.
I got fired, and...
I cried in front of everyone and...
I ate that French fry from my car.
It was just such a hard day."
Your boyfriend's like, "Aw, babe.
You want to talk about it?"
You're, like, "Yeah."
He's, like, "Just kidding.
Psych."
That's what it would be like.

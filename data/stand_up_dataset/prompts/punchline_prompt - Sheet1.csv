Hasan_Minhaj_2,"Whatever, it\'s not going to happen. He can\'t do this."
Iliza_Shlesinger,It’s the most exciting part of the relationship.
Iliza_Shlesinger,"You’re both on your best behavior, it’s still electric, you’re not totally sure about the history of mental illness in each family."
Iliza_Shlesinger,"Welcome to Fuckdome, Scott."
Iliza_Shlesinger,"It’s a weird mental game. Boy’s coming over for the first time, you’re trying to reconcile the beautiful home that your mother kept that you lived in growing up, with the beautiful home that, like, Pinterest says you’re supposed to have."
Iliza_Shlesinger_2,"You don’t want to wear your civilian clothes, okay."
Iliza_Shlesinger_2,No means no.

Joe_List,"Oh, I guess it\'s pronounced tin-uh-dus."
Joe_List,"This gentleman is a doctor, he seems very smart. This fella seems, less smart, but, extremely adamant about the pronunciation of this word."
Joe_List,"Tomato, to-mah-to."
Joe_List_2,You\'re like what a fucking idiot back there.

Jimmy_Yang,I’m 5′ 5″. I just go to concerts to smell other people’s armpits.
Jimmy_Yang,Are you guys aware of that? I’m 5′ 5″. I just go to concerts to smell other people’s armpits.

Nate_Bargatze,She just watches kids playing with toys. 
Nate_Bargatze_2,Homework\'s fun.
Nate_Bargatze_2,"Okay, learning it earlier than we used to, huh?"
Nate_Bargatze_2,It\'s a whole new math.
Nate_Bargatze_2,"I don\'t even know if that\'s true, but… It\'s just a new math."
Nate_Bargatze_2,Oh! Just do that at the top. I don\'t even know what we\'re doing.
Nate_Bargatze_2,It\'s a long way to get at the same answer.
Nate_Bargatze_TK,"It goes clown, then magic."

Russell_Peters,There’s no way you can be Indian and not have fucking acid reflux.
Russell_Peters,"I’m looking at all of you, especially all the pudgy guys. You know exactly who has it. You got it, don’t you, yellow guy?"
Russell_Peters,"I know, I have it, but I don’t want to say because my shirt looks like turmeric,"

Trevor_Noah,I\'m not particularly comfortable in the house at night by myself.
Trevor_Noah,What I\'m trying to say is I\'m afraid of the dark.

Tom_Segura,"There\'s a .357 and a shotgun on my bed. Anybody comes in here, blast ’em."
Tom_Segura,That\'s what\'s up.
Tom_Segura_2,"I was trying to figure out, “Why does this feel so good?” I think it’s a taste of power. Like most of us, we have no power in our everyday lives. But if you’re alone in an elevator, -you are lord of the elevator shaft. You get to decide, like a king with his drawbridge."
Tom_Segura_2,"Sometimes, a second later it opens, and you’re like, “Fuck!” You get nervous energy, like you’re a kid. You’re like, “I’m in trouble.”"

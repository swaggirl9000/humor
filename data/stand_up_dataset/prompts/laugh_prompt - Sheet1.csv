Jimmy_Yang,I just go to concerts to smell other people’s armpits.
Jimmy_Yang_2,"Old Asian people, they don’t watch TV. They judge the TV."
Jimmy_Yang_2,"He’s just sitting there, arms folded, judging the TV like–He’s made some random noises around the house."
Jimmy_Yang_2,"It’s just like, achoo! Oh! Ay, shit.Oh! I’m like, what the fuck, Dad, just have an orgasm? What was that?"

Nate_Bargatze_2,"Okay, learning it earlier than we used to, huh?"
Nate_Bargatze_2,It’s a whole new math.
Nate_Bargatze_2,"I don’t even know if that’s true, but… It’s just a new math."
Nate_Bargatze_2,Oh! Just do that at the top. I don’t even know what we’re doing.
Nate_Bargatze_2,It’s a long way to get at the same answer.
Nate_Bargatze_2,Do you mind coming in through the back door?
Nate_Bargatze_TK,"It goes clown, then magic."

Sam_Morril,"I prefer to think of myself as an accidental hero. I have a negative-one rapes, so, you know."
Sam_Morril,It\'s hard not to drink man. It\'s very hard.
Sam_Morril_2,"Isn’t that weird that they can do anti-smoking ads, but you can’t do pro-cigarette commercials?"
Sam_Morril_2,"Oh, I don’t smoke. So then she goes outside and bums them from another guy, and they go home together and they fuck and that’s the whole commercial."

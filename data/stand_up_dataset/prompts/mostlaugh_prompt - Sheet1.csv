Nate_Bargatze_2,It\'s a whole new math.
Nate_Bargatze_2,Oh! Just do that at the top. I don\'t even know what we\'re doing.
Nate_Bargatze_2,It\'s a long way to get at the same answer.
Nate_Bargatze_TK,"It goes clown, then magic."
Nate_Bargatze_TK,The Easter Bunny was in the passenger seat.
Nate_Bargatze_TK,"Like, he couldn’t sit normal, so his head was bent to the side."
Nate_Bargatze_TK,I remember it didn’t fit. The Easter Bunny head didn’t fit in the car.
Nate_Bargatze_TK_2,We gotta be there Monday for this wedding? It’s a week?
Nate_Bargatze_TK_2,Let’s do it without it.
Nate_Bargatze_TK_2,"Your back, and you’re like, ‘Put your jacket on backwards. Flip it around.’"

Sam_Morril,"That\'s not how I want to think about it, you know?"
Sam_Morril,"I have a negative-one rapes, so, you know."
Sam_Morril,It\'s hard not to drink man.
Sam_Morril,I work in a place where there\'s a bar every night. I\'ve been trying to be good.
Sam_Morril,That\'s a very helpful example.
Sam_Morril,That\'s so much better than crack.
Sam_Morril,"Thanks, we didn\'t know."
Sam_Morril_2,"Isn’t that weird that they can do anti-smoking ads, but you can’t do pro-cigarette commercials?"
Sam_Morril_2,"A hot girl walks up to a guy in the bar and asks to bum a cigarette, and he goes, oh, I don’t smoke."

Tom_Segura,"There\'s a .357 and a shotgun on my bed. Anybody comes in here, blast ’em."
Tom_Segura,"That\'s what\'s up."""
Tom_Segura_2,"I got such a warm rush through my body. It felt like the inside of my body hugged the outside of my body, you know?"
Tom_Segura_2,"There’s “Hold Open,” and “Close.” And you can watch people walk up and be like, “Mm-mm.” -And you hit that. And then you see it close, and you’re like… Sometimes, a second later it opens, and you’re like, “Fuck!” You get nervous energy, like you’re a kid. You’re like, “I’m in trouble'"

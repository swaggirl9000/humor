Donald_Glover,38.79,41.441,He was just allowed to have mints. So he would steal mints by the handful.
Donald_Glover,44.903,53.441,So his breath was so fresh... the vapors from his own mouth made his eyes water.
Donald_Glover,68.88,73.824,"And I would take him to the park and I was the only boy there, you know, I was hanging out. You know, they were cool."
Donald_Glover,90.491,94.607,"You know, we'd trade jerk- chicken recipes and stuff."
Donald_Glover,107.842,110.958,"And he goes, ""Shut up."" And she goes, ""Don't you talk to me like that, I am a grown-up, you will respect me."""
Donald_Glover,125.042,128.508,And the lady goes... I shit you not...
Donald_Glover_2,20.288,26.293,"I was hanging out in my neighborhood and this girl was jogging and we started talking about a rape that had happened in the neighborhood, and we were talking about... ""Oh, this is awful, this is so messed up. I can't believe this happened so close to us."""

Donald_Glover_2,45.151,46.488,"Uh... Two things, lady."
Donald_Glover_2,49.068,51.297,"Number one, he's a rapist."
Donald_Glover_2,56.246,71.937,It's probably pretty high. Number two... you can shit on command?

Anthony_Jeselnik,16.898,19.405,"When I was a kid, I used to fantasize about getting older, growing up and having money, and buying my mom nice things for her birthday. When I was a kid, we were poor."

Anthony_Jeselnik,34.874,36.233,"Weird joke to clap for, but sure."
Anthony_Jeselnik,43.756,48.912,My mom actually should've been on one of the planes that crashed on 9/11.
Anthony_Jeselnik,86.505,88.497,"And when I did that, my mom would act weird. She'd pull me aside and say, ""Anthony, who's your new friend?"
Anthony_Jeselnik,93.982,100.708,"And I would say, ""Shut up, Mom, that's racist. Put your money away."
Anthony_Jeselnik,114.653,120.278,"And we never talk, write letters or any of that shit. 'Cause they're all in jail for the exact same thing."
Anthony_Jeselnik_2,53.522,57.255,"Like... Mark Twain out of my grandma's mouth, it would just come to life."" And then I couldn't help myself."

Chelsea_Peretti,59.008,67.306,"She calls him by a word that I really feel is one of the more disgusting words in the English language. She calls him her ""hubby,"" which, to me is on par with the ""N"" word."

Chelsea_Peretti_2,29.9807,34.641,"This is an actual thing. It's not to make them look youthful, you know."
Chelsea_Peretti_2,38.318,41.503,"""Hi, everyone, same old me."""
Chelsea_Peretti_2,52.301,61.693,"But the reason I know about it is I met a girl who did it, and she was like, ""It worked. I did stop sweating out of my armpits, but I started sweating out of my butthole."""
Chelsea_Peretti_2,64.152,72.795,"So, I'm... uh... Is that a good trade? like, kind of a deal with the devil."
Chelsea_Peretti_2,78.393,99.004,"Then I'm imagining the guy that sees her out somewhere and is just like... ""Oh, ho, ho, ho."" He's like... [constricted laughter] He's like, [surfer voice] ""She is so fucking hot."
Chelsea_Peretti_2,102.916,107.811,"He's like, ""I'm so drawn to you, but I can't get near you! This is a whole new kind of juicy booty."""

Louis_CK,57.949,64.031,"""That finally makes sense. I didn't even know."
Louis_CK,65.54,67.379,"Oh, fuck, that's me!"
Louis_CK_2,19.604329896907217,31.159823269513993,It's sad how dumb they are. They're in our lives and they know nothing about what's happening.

John_Mulaney,73.527,74.207,That sleep shirt bullshit.
John_Mulaney,83.9075,85.899,"""Well, if it's too big you can just wear it as a sleep shirt."""
John_Mulaney,97.755,105.98,"""Because we don't say that when someone gives us a gift because that would not be polite."" Oh, I get it."
John_Mulaney,113.782,125.0765,"So rather than violate these meaningless politeness rules, I'll just go to bed in a smock like goddamn Ebenezer Scrooge."

John_Mulaney_2,61.66030507886982,62.71412723175593,You're adults and he's not even here.
John_Mulaney_2,76.74167100017334,77.23345467152019,So try being seven years old and you're sitting five feet away from him. He's still got blood on his shoes.

John_Mulaney_2,115.59258103657479,118.70721095510486,"None of that matters, but it's important to me that you know that. He did not look like his job description."
John_Mulaney_2,120.72118218062054,123.53137458831685,"He looked like he should be the conductor on a locomotive powered by confetti. But, instead, he made his living in murder."
Ali_Wong,21.007,28.986,It was like the worst experience of my life. It was so emotional.
Ali_Wong,33.005,37.756,We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82... manual. The manual.
Ali_Wong,48.803,51.189,We were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade. It cost like $200.
Ali_Wong,58.001,69.002,All because what? It could graph.

Ali_Wong_2,63.2116,65.0634,"I need children to be there for me when I'm older, when I get as old as her. And when I say be there for me, I mean pay for me when my husband isn't around to support me anymore."

Iliza_Shlesinger,27.0834,29.953,I don't know. I can't say empirically how fun being married is.
Iliza_Shlesinger,43.7608,45.129,"The beginning of a relationship is exciting because it's brand new. You're both on your best behavior, it's still electric, you're not totally sure about the history of mental illness in each family."

Iliza_Shlesinger,108.979,109.358,"But it's interesting, in your 20s, it's a weird mental game. Boy's coming over for the first time, you're trying to reconcile the beautiful home that your mother kept that you lived in growing up, with the beautiful home that, like, Pinterest says you're supposed to have."
Iliza_Shlesinger,112.762,115.738,"And the fact that you have no fucking money, so... Should I buy a rug or eat dinner?"
Iliza_Shlesinger_2,9.735,15.507,"Don't want work clothes. You don't want to wear your daytime clothes, 'cause... 'cause it's nighttime."
Iliza_Shlesinger_2,33.498,35.787,"However, at the other end of the sartorial spectrum, you don't want to go, like, super hardcore sexy the first time a guy's coming over. Just relax."
Iliza_Shlesinger_2,77.43,78.8497,"This is less about that, and more about just being mentally kind to the other person. You show up in that, he'll be, like, ""Oh, my god!"""

Jim_Gaffigan_2,11.892,13.087,"Recently, I was invited to a surprise birthday party. It was a surprise birthday party for a dog."

Joe_List_2,75.288,77.264,"Don't fall for it, it's a trap. Plus isn't it fun to not ask somebody a question when they really want you to ask them a question?"

Nate_Bargatze_2,67.865,70.543,It's not like old math isn't working. Old math still...
Nate_Bargatze_2,90.537,93.376,"""Does the front door not work?"" ""No, it works."
Nate_Bargatze_TK,9.292,11.846,My dad is a magician. He's done that my entire life.
Nate_Bargatze_TK,16.367,22.782,"It goes clown, then magic. There's two steps."
Nate_Bargatze_TK,26.02,27.421,"I was born, he was a clown. It was never weird to me."
Nate_Bargatze_TK,48.091,50.253,How else would he come home? And...
Nate_Bargatze_TK,55.689,59.162,"The Easter Bunny was in the passenger seat. That's the first thing that I remember, to my life."
Nate_Bargatze_TK,72.16,74.112,"The Easter Bunny head didn't fit in the car. Like, he couldn't sit normal, so his head was bent to the side."
Nate_Bargatze_TK,80.708,83.245,"And I remember he had his seat belt on, and he's just like... and I was like... I like to think about all the other people that saw that."
Nate_Bargatze_TK_2,13.984,15.303,"It was a real redneck affair. It was right outside Louisville, Kentucky, where my parents are from."
Nate_Bargatze_TK_2,24.249,28.361,"And my cousin's name is Tuesday, which is a good start. The invitation said, ""Tuesday's getting married, rehearsal's Friday, wedding's Saturday."""
Nate_Bargatze_TK_2,37.646,39.765,I'm wildly overdressed. I look like I work there.
Nate_Bargatze_TK_2,50.124,51.042,"He has his tuxedo jacket, pants, cummerbund, bowtie. No shirt."
Nate_Bargatze_TK_2,64.18,65.875,"You know? He has a body that you're like, ""Put your jacket on backwards."
Nate_Bargatze_TK_2,70.216,76.073,"Yeah. Then you see his back, and you're like, ""Oof."
Russell_Peters,10.549,11.106,"I go, what do you mean what else is wrong with me? He goes, look, you're a 48-year-old Indian man."
Russell_Peters,17.367,18.713,"I'm like, that's really fucking racist, but since you asked, I have acid reflux."
Russell_Peters,23.074,23.734,I don't know. Does anybody else- who else has acid reflux in here?
Russell_Peters,38.771,41.336,Because there is no way you can be Indian and not have fucking acid reflux. It's inevitable.
Russell_Peters,51.251,54.234,"Dad, I want to assure you I have no phagus in me. No, no, son, esophagus."
Russell_Peters,70.283,71.202,"You got it, don't you, yellow guy? You do, do you."
Russell_Peters_2,17.69572953736655,19.65405693950178,"But I started settling into the idea because I started thinking of names for identical twins. I was like, if I have twin girls- because you've got to have fun with the names."
Russell_Peters_2,21.423629893238434,23.42914590747331,"If I have twin girls, these are going to be my daughters, it's going to be Kate and Duplicate."
Russell_Peters_2,25.576227758007118,27.227829181494663,"These are my boys, it's Pete and Repeat."
Russell_Peters_2,32.30060498220641,38.151992882562276,"Identical twins, that's like bragging rights for you, you know I mean. That's your way of going, look."
Russell_Peters_2,50.0435231316726,51.12886120996441,"Look, look. Or because you're Punjabi, look at how good my junk they are."
Russell_Peters_2,55.51740213523132,57.66448398576512,Looks at this.Look at how good my balls are.
Russell_Peters_2,61.36879003558719,64.76637010676157,"My balls are so strong, they made one kid and then it made the exact same kid right away. You lift up your balls, sponsored by Xerox."
Sam_Morril,9.583,15.102,"I got roofied at a party in college by accident, but you know, it still counts. Obviously, it was an accident."
Sam_Morril,21.481,25.54,"That is male privilege right there, isn't it? I just told a room full of people I got roofied."
Sam_Morril,28.657,30.06,"I did not see one concerned face in here. Everyone in here is like I assume things worked out for you, and they did."
Sam_Morril,43.711,47.941,"And he gave me this hateful look, and I thought, why is this guy so mad at me? And then I chugged it, and I woke up the next morning, and I was like oh."
Sam_Morril,51.8923,53.855,That guy's a sexual predator. And my friend said you ruined his night.
Sam_Morril,56.099,57.642,"And I was like, that's not how I want to think about it, you know?"
Sam_Morril,59.629,64.21,You don't want to think of yourself as a -block to some monster.
Sam_Morril,67.623,68.021,"I have a negative-one rapes, so, you know. Statistically, you know..."
Sam_Morril,78.3,80.526,"I can't take all the credit, you know? It's kind of like if I was driving drunk and I just swerved and accidentally hit a mugger."
Sam_Morril,107.6833,109.114,"I read this article that said try to replace drinking with another activity like tennis with a friend. I was like, yeah, that's a very helpful example."
Sam_Morril,114.186,115.612,That's always the crossroads I find myself at at 4:57 a.m. I can't tell you how often I'm coming out of a blackout like I should have done doubles instead.
Sam_Morril,123.0456,124.653,"I brought my Wilson racket and everything. You tell me to replace an addiction with cardio, that's very helpful."
Sam_Morril,128.258,129.497,I'm gonna start walking into halfway houses full of crack heads like have you guys done Zumba?
Sam_Morril,135.364,136.509,"It's so much better than crack. They're like, thanks, we didn't know."
Sam_Morril,140.389,143.171,That was helpful. Of course you want to get fucked up.
Sam_Morril,160.609,162.035,Everyone hears voices in their head. Good people just don't listen to them.
Sam_Morril,178.233,179.776,"It's not, you know? Why is E. Honda butt-fucking me?"
Sam_Morril_2,33.412824933687006,36.803209549071624,"How 'bout this for like a casual smoker? A hot girl walks up to a guy in the bar and asks to bum a cigarette, and he goes, oh, I don't smoke."
Sam_Morril_2,40.10006631299735,43.25663129973476,"So then she goes outside and bums them from another guy, and they go home together and they fuck and that's the whole commercial."
Sam_Morril_2,49.85034482758621,55.50877984084881,"Marlboro: Just in Case. All right, I got some momentum."
Sam_Morril_2,63.248209549071625,64.65112732095491,"My friend just had one, and her boyfriend didn't contribute to the cost, which I thought was not cool, you know? She's going through it, yeah."
Sam_Morril_2,69.79515915119364,70.47323607427056,"That is how low the bar is. I'm like, guy should pay a little bit for the abortion, and women are like, he's a hero."
Sam_Morril_2,79.31161803713529,80.69115384615385,"No, even the most pro-life person I talk to was like, wow, chivalry is dead. That was the baby's name, Chivalry."
Sam_Morril_2,83.6840450928382,85.62474801061009,"I'm just saying. That one's not for everybody, that joke."
Sam_Morril_2,91.65729442970823,94.6735676392573,"I did that joke the other night and somebody yelled out boo. I thought it was the baby's ghost, but, you know."
Sam_Morril_2,100.19171087533158,102.55328912466845,I'm just saying there are still gentlemen.
Sam_Morril_2,104.61090185676395,106.3177851458886,"If I knock you up and you need an abortion, it's on the house."
Sam_Morril_2,108.51568965517242,110.08228116710876,"I'll throw my Delta SkyMiles card right on the counter. Are you sure, Sam?"
Sam_Morril_2,112.65429708222813,116.27850132625996,I got this.
Sam_Morril_2,118.2659681697613,122.35781167108755,"With all the rewards and benefits that Delta has to offer, I'd be a fool to do otherwise."
Sam_Morril_2,123.97116710875333,127.26802387267907,"I'm two to three abortions away from Diamond Medallion status, so..."
Sam_Morril_2,143.12099469496022,143.56525198938994,"I'm losing some of you, but I'm gonna take it a step further here. I think you should get extra SkyMiles points with an abortion, because that's one less crying baby onboard, you know?"
Sam_Morril_2,147.42327586206898,149.78485411140585,"That, yeah, I don't... Me personally, I don't like doing that part of the joke, but I have a sponsorship deal with Delta, and you know, they get very upset when I leave it out."
Sam_Morril_2,157.26708222811672,166.058700265252,"I was talking to a guy after a show. He told me there was gonna be an anti-abortion parade, which I think he meant to say march, you know?"
Sam_Morril_2,169.49584880636607,173.68122015915122,I want to see what the floats look like. That one looks unfinished.
Trevor_Noah,28.251,30.529,"I'll share this with you, I don't mind. I, uh- I'm not particularly comfortable in the house at night by myself."
Trevor_Noah,37.232,40.139,"What I'm trying to say is I'm afraid of the dark. And I know it's stupid to be afraid of the dark, right?"
Trevor_Noah,64.336,67.965,"When I go to the bathroom, do I turn the lights on and lose my sleep? Or do I leave the lights off and shit myself?"
Trevor_Noah,75.587,82.391,I never know which one to go with. But what I started doing now is I leave the lights off.
Trevor_Noah,84.612,86.553,"It sounds crazy, but I feel safe. I feel like I'm the most dangerous thing in the night."
Trevor_Noah,90.69,95.057,"You'll find me at three a.m., barefoot, walking to the toilet, like, ""Yes. Big boy got to make a pee-pee."
Trevor_Noah,101.726,105.023,"It's potty time."" I feel safe, like even if there's a monster under the bed, he'd be like, ""Is that a Russian?"""
Trevor_Noah,174.178,175.568,"Just whip out your Russian and kill it dead. As soon as he says, ""Don't be such a bitch!"""
Trevor_Noah_2,13.273,17.662,You can't do normal things with that voice. You are destined for greatness.
Trevor_Noah_2,26.474,27.698,"""Who the hell is this?!"" ""I'm not telling you."""
Trevor_Noah_2,38.852,40.535,"[laughs] It just doesn't work. I remember when Nelson Mandela was still alive, and he would tell jokes at press conferences and events, and no one would laugh."
Trevor_Noah_2,49.724,51.042,He still kept what was him. It was partly because of that voice.
Trevor_Noah_2,60.423,62.326,"People would be like, ""Let him in. Let him in!"""
Trevor_Noah_2,74.216,78.397,Who's here? Who are we?'
Tom_Segura,22.42,25.351,"I just walked up to that shit, 15. This dude's like, ""You trying to get a sack?"""
Tom_Segura,31.113,32.456,"Cool."" And he goes, ""We just need to go get it."""
Tom_Segura,43.95,46.023,"He goes, ""I'll go get it. You stay here and watch my place."""
Tom_Segura,56.503,58.176,"Anybody comes in here, blast 'em."" Inside?"
Tom_Segura,61.4021,63.451,"Paralysis. But what I said was, ""That's what's up."""
Tom_Segura_2,44.776,47.44,"And you can watch people walk up and be like, ""Mm-mm."" -And you hit that."
Tom_Segura_2,50.788,53.995,"And then you see it close, and you're like..."
Tom_Segura_2,58.97,60.597,"Sometimes, a second later it opens, and you're like, ""Fuck!"" You get nervous energy, like you're a kid."

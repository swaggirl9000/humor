Chelsea_Peretti,"It’s like that wedding portraiture, where it’s just like, two assholes back to back in the woods, just like… [laughing shrilly] “To the future!”"
Chelsea_Peretti,"This same girl on Facebook, all her posts and all her updates are about her husband. That’s all she seems to write or think about, but she doesn’t call him her husband, which would be awesome, and she doesn’t call him by his name, which would also be great."
Chelsea_Peretti_2,People say I look just like you.

Jim_Gaffigan_2,"And to be fair, the dog was surprised. Didn’t suspect a thing."
Jim_Gaffigan_2,The dog didn’t know it was his birthday. The dog didn’t know it had a birthday.

He was like, “Dude, Jesus couldn’t be Jewish. Think"

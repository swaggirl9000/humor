Donald_Glover_2,"Yeah, well, “if anybody ever tries to rape me, I’m just gonna shit on ’em.” “Yes, I will. I have no problem.”"

John_Mulaney,"It was charitable, but it was also fast and violent, because I was throwing boxes at people."
John_Mulaney_2,Go ahead and laugh. His name is ridiculous. That was his name. It was JJ Bittenbinder.
John_Mulaney_2,"Very sorry, Radio City, did that make you uncomfortable? Well, guess what? You’re adults and he’s not even here. So try being seven years old and you’re sitting five feet away from him."

Russell_Peters,"You know exactly who has it. You got it, don’t you, yellow guy?"
Russell_Peters,Because there is no way you can be Indian and not have fucking acid reflux.

Sam_Morril,"And I was like, I’ll drink it. And he gave me this hateful look, and I thought, why is this guy so mad at me? And then I chugged it, and I woke up the next morning, and I was like oh. That guy’s'"
Sam_Morril_2,"It’s weird that they can do anti-smoking ads, but you can’t do pro-cigarette commercials. Isn’t that weird? They don’t give ’em a rebuttal."
Sam_Morril_2,"A hot girl walks up to a guy in the bar and asks to bum a cigarette, and he goes, oh, I don’t smoke. So then she goes outside and bums them from another guy, and they go home together and they fuck and that’s the whole commercial. There at the end, it just says, “Wouldn’t kill you',"
Trevor_Noah,You know how I know this? You know how I’ve learned? Because I’ve learned how to use the Russian accent for myself.
Trevor_Noah,"I’ll share this with you, I don’t mind. I, uh– I’m not particularly comfortable in the house at night by myself. What I’m trying to say is I’m afraid of the dark."

Tom_Segura,"That’s what’s up.” -Like, yeah, man. Pow.*"
Tom_Segura_2,"I got such a warm rush through my body. It felt like the inside of my body hugged the outside of my body, you know?"
Tom_Segura_2,"I think it’s a taste of power. Like most of us, we have no power in our everyday lives"
Tom_Segura_2,"You are lord of the elevator shaft. You get to decide, like a king with his drawbridge."
Tom_Segura_2,"And you can watch people walk up and be like, “Mm-mm.” -And you hit that."

Donald_Glover_3,"I’m sorry, but are there any terms or phrases in your act “that don’t exist in sign language that I have to make up on the spot?"
Donald_Glover_3,Yeah. Niglet?
Donald_Glover_3,Oh.
Hasan_Minhaj_3,You’re going to die. Laugh. Why aren’t you laughing? You’re always stressed and always tired.

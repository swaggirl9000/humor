Anthony_Jeselnik,"Most of them are in jail, to be honest."
Anthony_Jeselnik_2,"And I know my grandma loved it too, because it combined her two favorite things: spending time with her grandchildren, and using the ‘N’ word."

Anthony_Jeselnik_2,"I am a real comedian. I am a pure comedian. I think I’m one of the best comedians of all time."""
Ali_Wong,Don’t ever do that with your mom.
Ali_Wong,It was so emotional. We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82… manual.
Ali_Wong,She don’t even know… where the calculator is.
Ali_Wong,It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade. It cost like $200. And everybody thought it could graph. It was like the Tesla of my time.
Ali_Wong_2,"My mom is 80, going through a full blown mid-life crisis. ‘Cause she knows that she’s got a century more to go."

Ali_Wong_2,"Old Chinese ladies, they don’t give a fuck. They got no shame."""

Chelsea_Peretti,"[giggles shrilly] “Uh-oh, it’s us again.” [trills]"
Chelsea_Peretti,"She calls him by a word that I really feel is one of the more disgusting words in the English language. She calls him her “hubby,” which, to me is on par with the “N” word."
Chelsea_Peretti_2,People say I look just like you.
Chelsea_Peretti_2,"It’s actually to stop them from sweating, because why would you, you know, as a human?"
Chelsea_Peretti_2,"It worked. I did stop sweating out of my armpits, but I started sweating out of my butthole"
Chelsea_Peretti_2,"Is that a good trade? like, kind of a deal with the devil."
Chelsea_Peretti_2,"Oh, ho, ho, ho."""

Donald_Glover,"the vapors from his own mouth made his eyes water"""
Donald_Glover,"And then like… Just, they would just bleed… It was crazy."
Donald_Glover_2,"Yeah, well, “if anybody ever tries to rape me, I’m just gonna shit on ’em.” “Yes, I will. I have no problem.”"
Donald_Glover_2,"Number one, he’s a rapist. So his tolerance for gross stuff is probably pretty high. It’s probably pretty high."""
Donald_Glover_2,"You can shit on command? Like, you can just… You can just poop whenever you want to? Just be like… Hyah! He’s like, “Oh God, no!”"
Hasan_Minhaj,"Are you fucking kidding? Thirteen episodes for this kid?"""
Hasan_Minhaj,Do you know when br0wn kids get slapped? Every br0wn birthday party.
Hasan_Minhaj,"And usually it’s the kid whose birthday it is, and we stand there and point and laugh. We go, “Ah, Biju got slapped on his birthday!"
Hasan_Minhaj,"It’s why we become cardiologists and win spelling bees."""
Hasan_Minhaj,"You ever seen an Indian kid win a spelling bee? Incredible! Ice water in the veins."""
Hasan_Minhaj_2,Getting into Stanford.
Hasan_Minhaj_2,"No, you have to live a life worth talking about, which is why I’m making it mandatory for everyone in this class to go to prom."
Hasan_Minhaj_2,"All 30 of us? We’re all going to prom? AP Calc? Us? Me, Jehovah’s Witness girl, Korean exchange students, going to the prom? Thirty for 30? All of us?"
Hasan_Minhaj_2,"Hanson, this is not funny."
Hasan_Minhaj_2,"Whatever, it’s not going to happen."
Iliza_Shlesinger,"Granted, I’m not married yet, so, technically, I’ve only had beginnings of relationships."
Iliza_Shlesinger,"You want him to come in and be, like, “It’s so homey. I’d like to stay forever.” Yes, come closer."
Iliza_Shlesinger,"In your 30s… In your 30s, homeboy knocks on the door, you open it, you’re in combat boots, nothing else, and a garbage can on fire, you’re, like, “Welcome to Fuckdome, Scott.” Ticket',"

Iliza_Shlesinger_2,"The blood’s gonna go from here to his dick, he’s gonna impale himself, he’s gonna sue you, and you ain’t got no money."
Jim_Gaffigan,We got nothing for you. And you can’t use our bathroom.
Jim_Gaffigan,Aw. Look at you try.
Jim_Gaffigan,"The fat pig is trying, the fat pig is trying, I…”\n* ""Good show.” “You nailed it.” I don’t care. I like to eat! I like to eat."
Jim_Gaffigan,"Well, you must know your way around the kitchen. I know where the food is."""
Jim_Gaffigan,"Well, you must love to cook. Look, I like to sleep. It doesn’t mean I wanna build a bed"
Jim_Gaffigan_2,I have friends that are mentally ill.
Jim_Gaffigan_2,Didn\'t suspect a thing. Dog didn’t know it was his birthday. The dog didn’t know it had a birthday.
Jim_Gaffigan_2,"Oh, one year equals seven for doggies? Okay. When I see a dog, I’ll do math. That’s not fulfilling some dog need, you know?"
Jim_Gaffigan_2,"There’s not a dog sitting in a bar right now going, “I’m not three, I’m 21! I can legally drink!”"
Joe_List,It’s one doctor. He knows all three body parts.

John_Mulaney,"It was charitable, but it was also fast and violent, because I was throwing boxes at people."
John_Mulaney_2,Go ahead and laugh. His name is ridiculous. That was his name. It was JJ Bittenbinder.
John_Mulaney_2,"Very sorry, Radio City, did that make you uncomfortable? Well, guess what? You’re adults and he’s not even here. So try being seven years old and you’re sitting five feet away from him."

Nate_Bargatze_2,"They throw some stuff in, you’re like, “Oh, all right. All right.” It’s, uh… “Okay, learning it earlier than we used to, huh?” I don’t even know if that’s true, but…"
Nate_Bargatze_2,"Common Core math. That’s fun. It’s a new math they invented, no heads up. Just give it to parents that never learned it."""
Nate_Bargatze_TK,"Uh… It goes clown, then magic. There’s two steps. You can take them in either order."
Nate_Bargatze_TK,I thought everybody’s dad was a clown.
Nate_Bargatze_TK,The Easter Bunny was in the passenger seat.
Nate_Bargatze_TK,"The Easter Bunny head didn’t fit in the car. Like, he couldn’t sit normal, so his head was bent to the side."

Russell_Peters,"You know exactly who has it. You got it, don’t you, yellow guy?"
Russell_Peters,Because there is no way you can be Indian and not have fucking acid reflux.
Russell_Peters,"It’s inevitable. There’s no way you can consume the food that we eat with that much spice, and that much oil, and that much butter, and not just have it burn a hole in your– as my dad would say– your esophagus."
Russell_Peters_2,"If I have twin girls– because you’ve got to have fun with the names. If I have twin girls, these are going to be my daughters, it’s going to be Kate and Duplicate. These are my boys, it’s Pete and Repeat."

Sam_Morril,"That is male privilege right there, isn’t it? I just told a room full of people I got roofied. I did not see one concerned face in here. Everyone in here is like I assume things worked out for you, and they did. Still weird, though."
Sam_Morril,"And I was like, I’ll drink it. And he gave me this hateful look, and I thought, why is this guy so mad at me? And then I chugged it, and I woke up the next morning, and I was like oh. That guy’s'"
Sam_Morril_2,"It’s weird that they can do anti-smoking ads, but you can’t do pro-cigarette commercials. Isn’t that weird? They don’t give ’em a rebuttal."
Sam_Morril_2,"A hot girl walks up to a guy in the bar and asks to bum a cigarette, and he goes, oh, I don’t smoke. So then she goes outside and bums them from another guy, and they go home together and they fuck and that’s the whole commercial. There at the end, it just says, “Wouldn’t kill you',"
Trevor_Noah,You know how I know this? You know how I’ve learned? Because I’ve learned how to use the Russian accent for myself.
Trevor_Noah,"I’ll share this with you, I don’t mind. I, uh– I’m not particularly comfortable in the house at night by myself. What I’m trying to say is I’m afraid of the dark."
Trevor_Noah,"But what happens is, I’ll be sleeping. And in the middle of the night, I’ll be woken up by the need to pee. And whenever that',"
Trevor_Noah_2,"And a Kit Kat, please."

Trevor_Noah_2,"Let him in. Let him in!"""
Trevor_Noah_2,"""No. No, no. You must say, ‘Who’s there?\'"
Trevor_Noah_2,"He is so right. We’ve always got to ask, ‘Who’s there?’ Who’s here? Who are we?’ Oh, my God"

Tom_Segura,"That’s what’s up.” -Like, yeah, man. Pow.*"
Tom_Segura_2,"I got such a warm rush through my body. It felt like the inside of my body hugged the outside of my body, you know?"
Tom_Segura_2,"I think it’s a taste of power. Like most of us, we have no power in our everyday lives"
Tom_Segura_2,"You are lord of the elevator shaft. You get to decide, like a king with his drawbridge."
Tom_Segura_2,"And you can watch people walk up and be like, “Mm-mm.” -And you hit that."

Recently, I was invited to a surprise birthday party.
It was a surprise birthday party for a dog.
That's right, I have friends that are mentally ill.I went, I went.
It was in my apartment building and I needed the material.And to be fair, the dog was surprised.
Didn't suspect a thing.
Dog didn't know it was his birthday.
The dog didn't know it had a birthday.
The dog wasn't sure why people were in the apartment.
It was the dog's third birthday, which in dog years doesn't matter.Someone made that up and we just went along with it.
Oh, one year equals seven for doggies?
Okay.
When I see a dog, I'll do math.
That's not fulfilling some dog need, you know?
There's not a dog sitting in a bar right now going, "I'm not three, I'm 21!
I can legally drink!"
That's not how dogs keep track of time.
If you have a dog, you know they don't keep track of time.
You've left your home, forgotten something, walked back in only to be greeted by your dog like you've just returned from war.
"You're back!
It's a miracle!
You're back after I don't know how long 'cause I'm a dog."

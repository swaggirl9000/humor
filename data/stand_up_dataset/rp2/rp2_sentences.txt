Identical twins are the only people that should be twins.
And I started getting scared when I thought my girlfriend was going to have twins.
But I started settling into the idea because I started thinking of names for identical twins.
I was like, if I have twin girls- because you've got to have fun with the names.
If I have twin girls, these are going to be my daughters, it's going to be Kate and Duplicate.
These are my boys, it's Pete and Repeat.
If I had twins with a black girl, this is Tyrone and Tyclone.
Identical twins, that's like bragging rights for you, you know I mean.
That's your way of going, look.
Look at how good my balls are.
Look, look.
Or because you're Punjabi, look at how good my junk they are.
Looks at this.Look at how good my balls are.
My balls are so strong, they made one kid and then it made the exact same kid right away.

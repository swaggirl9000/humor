Have you seen the show called The Slap?
This is a real show on NBC.
This is a real show about a white kid that gets slapped at a birthday party.
Are you fucking kidding?
Thirteen episodes for this kid?
Are you kidding me?
Do you know when br0wn kids get slapped?
Every br0wn birthday party.
And usually it's the kid whose birthday it is, and we stand there and point and laugh.
We go, "Ah, Biju got slapped on his birthday!"
And that's what makes us tough and resilient.
It's why we become cardiologists and win spelling bees.
Slapping is important.
It elevates your game.You ever seen an Indian kid win a spelling bee?
Incredible!
Ice water in the veins.
[laughter] That kid won't choke on camera.
He's been slapped on camera.Of course he can spell "knaidel".Knaidel.Look at that face.
Nothing.
Nothing!
He's 12 years old.
Nothing!
This kid just won $30,000 cash.
Nothing.
People ask, "Where does that come from?"
Look at this kid's parents.
Your son just won the Scripps National Spelling Bee.
Look at his brother.
His brother is like, "I'm fucked.
I'm fucked.
The bar is way too high.
I should kill myself."
People say, "Where's Bobby Jindal from?"
That's where he comes from.
That is an Indian sociopath.

I bought weed from a dude in a stand-alone trailer one time. Not a trailer park. A solo trailer. The most terrifying housing situation that exists. Where other trailer people are like, “Get the fuck out of here.” Kick ’em out. I just walked up to that shit, 15. This dude’s like, “You trying to get a sack?” -I was like, “Oh, shit. Yeah.” “We could go do that.” I was like, “All right. Cool.” And he goes, “We just need to go get it.” I was like, “You don’t fuckin’ have it? Isn’t that your sole responsibility?” I tried to play cool, “Let’s go get it.” He goes, “I’ll go get it. You stay here and watch my place.” And I was like… “Okay.” Then he goes, “There’s a .357 and a shotgun on my bed. Anybody comes in here, blast ’em.” Inside? Paralysis. But what I said was, “That’s what’s up.” -Like, yeah, man. Pow. Then he stopped at the door. “But don’t shoot my mom.” I go, “Can we get a description before we agree to terms? How about a height and weight on old mom?”

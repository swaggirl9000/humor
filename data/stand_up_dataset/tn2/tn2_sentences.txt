Nelson Mandela was destined for greatness because of that voice.
He could not be a normal man with a voice like that.
You can't do normal things with that voice.
You are destined for greatness.
You can't be running in the streets: "And a Kit Kat, please."
No.
No.
It's so unique.
You can't be silly.
What are you making, prank phone calls?
"Who the hell is this?!"
"I'm not telling you."
[laughs] It just doesn't work.
I remember when Nelson Mandela was still alive, and he would tell jokes at press conferences and events, and no one would laugh.
Because everyone thought a man who had been in jail for 27 years couldn't make a joke.
And yet, he still did.
He still kept what was him.
It was partly because of that voice.
He would tell the joke, and it would just sound too epic for people to laugh.
Everything he did, he'd just be like, "Ah, knock, knock."
People would be like, "Let him in.
Let him in!"
"No.
No, no.
You must say, 'Who's there?'"
"He is so right.
We've always got to ask, 'Who's there?'
Who's here?
Who are we?'
Oh, my God!"
It was because of that voice, the first black president voice

Anthony_Jeselnik,"When I was a kid, we were poor. So poor I remember, just so I could go to my senior prom, I had to sell my U.S. passport on the street. Sold my passport on the street for 300 bucks to get to go to my prom. Of course this was before 9/11 so… my bad, everybody."
Anthony_Jeselnik,My mom actually should’ve been on one of the planes that crashed on 9/11. I think.
Anthony_Jeselnik,My mom could be very racist. Very racist. And I do not tolerate racism. That’s ignorance and I hate that.
Anthony_Jeselnik,"When I was a kid, like nine years old, I’d come home after school. Once in a while, I’d bring a black friend over. And when I did that, my mom would act weird. She’d pull me aside and say, 'Anthony, who’s your new friend? Is he a drug dealer?' And I would say, 'Shut up, Mom, that’s racist. Put your money away.'"
Anthony_Jeselnik,"Most of them are in jail, to be honest. And we never talk, write letters or any of that shit. ‘Cause they’re all in jail for the exact same thing. My testimony."
Ali_Wong,We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82… manual. The manual. She don’t even know… where the calculator is.
Ali_Wong,Those of you under 25 probably don’t know what that calculator is. It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eighth grade. It cost like $200. And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson’s laptop from the future.
Ali_Wong,All because what? It could graph. It was like the Tesla of my time.
Ali_Wong,"And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, 'You never know when you might need this.' And I was like, 'But… I do know… that I’m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.'"
Ali_Wong,"And I’m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that’s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success.'"
Hasan_Minhaj,Have you seen the show called The Slap? This is a real show on NBC. This is a real show about a white kid that gets slapped at a birthday party. Are you fucking kidding? Thirteen episodes for this kid? Are you kidding me?
Hasan_Minhaj,"Do you know when br0wn kids get slapped? Every br0wn birthday party. And usually it’s the kid whose birthday it is, and we stand there and point and laugh. We go, 'Ah, Biju got slapped on his birthday!'"
Hasan_Minhaj,And that’s what makes us tough and resilient. It’s why we become cardiologists and win spelling bees. Slapping is important. It elevates your game.
Hasan_Minhaj,You ever seen an Indian kid win a spelling bee? Incredible! Ice water in the veins. That kid won’t choke on camera. He’s been slapped on camera.
Hasan_Minhaj,"Of course he can spell 'knaidel'. Knaidel. Look at that face. Nothing. Nothing! He’s 12 years old. Nothing! This kid just won $30,000 cash. Nothing."
Hasan_Minhaj,"People ask, 'Where does that come from?' Look at this kid’s parents. Your son just won the Scripps National Spelling Bee. Look at his brother. His brother is like, 'I’m fucked. I’m fucked. The bar is way too high. I should kill myself.'"
Hasan_Minhaj,"People say, 'Where’s Bobby Jindal from?' That’s where he comes from. That is an Indian sociopath."
Joe_List,"So I went to the ear, nose, throat doctor, which is a cool doctor. It’s one doctor. He knows all three body parts. I was hoping it was three doctors saving money, by sharing a small office. He’s like, 'I’m Bill, this is Susan, and Ted. Ear, nose, throat. Who do ya need?'"
Joe_List,"I went for my ear, I have an ear issue called, tinnitus, or tin-uh-dus. That’s when your ears ring. You got it? Yeah, it’s frustrating. It’s when your ears ring, or buzz all the time."
Joe_List,"I thought it was called tinnitus, but then I watched a YouTube video, and the doctor in the video, he kept saying 'tin-uh-dus.' And so I was like, 'Oh, I guess it’s pronounced tin-uh-dus.' But then I went to the comments section, and the first comment said, 'This guy’s a fake ass fucking retard doctor. It’s pronounced t-ah-n-i-tus.' All caps."
Joe_List,"This gentlemen is a doctor, he seems very smart. This fella seems, less smart, but, extremely adamant about the pronunciation of this word. Tomato, to-mah-to. However you say it."
Joe_List,"If you have it, don’t go to the doctor, they don’t do shit. I went to the doctor I was like, 'Doc, I have uh, tinnitus, or tin-uh-dus. Whatever you guys are calling it. My ears are ringing.' And then he said, 'Okay, I’m gonna test your hearing.'"
Joe_List,"I was like, 'Oh no, that’s okay. My hearing is great. I hear everything, plus ringing, so. I kind of have superpower hearing, if you think about it. I’m hearing shit that’s not even in the room.'"
John_Mulaney,"We made these big piles of clothes, we put the piles into these big boxes, then we put the boxes into the back of my car, and then they stayed there for four months."
John_Mulaney,"And then one day my wife said, 'Hey, you took that stuff to Goodwill, right?' And I said, 'Of course I did! On an unrelated note, I’m going to walk out the front door right now.'"
John_Mulaney,"It was charitable, but it was also fast and violent, because I was throwing boxes at people. The boxes were so heavy I couldn’t even say what was in them. I was like, 'This one’s shirts. I got a bunch of shirts! Take ’em away!'"
John_Mulaney,"How do I write that on my taxes? 'Dear IRS, please deduct from my federal income tax one XXL Billabong T-shirt from youth. It was too big. My mom said it could be a sleep shirt. Please deduct this from my 2017 income.'"
John_Mulaney,"That sleep shirt bullshit. 'Well, if it’s too big you can just wear it as a sleep shirt.' No, I get that, Mom, but why don’t we just tell our relatives that I’m a four-year-old boy and I don’t wear a man’s XXL T-shirt?"
John_Mulaney,"Why don’t you give me a candle for looking in the mirror and a floppy hat and I’ll tremble off to bed in my long Victorian nightgown? Was there ever even a ghost, Mother, or was the dead Victorian girl you saw just me all along?"
Jimmy_Yang,"Asian people, we don’t need Tinder anymore. We just go to BTS concerts. That’s how we do that parking lot pimping."
Jimmy_Yang,"I’ve been dating a lot of tall girls lately, because it makes me look successful. No, no. I think tall women are beautiful. But some of them like to wear heels. That’s just disrespect."
Jimmy_Yang,"Like, you’re already five inches taller than me. Why the fuck are you wearing heels? She’s like, it makes my ass look better. I’m like, your ass is at my eye level right now. Neither of us look good, OK? I look like a child, and you look like a child molester."
Jimmy_Yang,"Last time I took a tall girl to this concert– I don’t know if you guys know this, but apparently, tall people have fun at concerts. Are you guys aware of that? I’m 5′ 5″. I just go to concerts to smell other people’s armpits."
Jimmy_Yang,"She was having the time of her life, doing whatever tall people do at concerts, you know, jumping around, obstructing other people’s views, seeing everything. I was frustrated. I had enough. So I just looked up at her, I was like, hey! Pick me up. This is bullshit. I paid for these tickets, OK? I want to see Billy Eilish, too. Come on."

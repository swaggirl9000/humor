The best wedding I've ever been to was my cousin's wedding.
It was a real redneck affair.
It was right outside Louisville, Kentucky, where my parents are from.
And my cousin's name is Tuesday, which is a good start.
The invitation said, "Tuesday's getting married, rehearsal's Friday, wedding's Saturday."
People were like, "We gotta be there Monday for this wedding?
How long is this wedding?
It's a week?"
We get there, I'm wearing a button-down shirt, khaki pants.
Nothing crazy.
I'm wildly overdressed.
I look like I work there.
-Uh... Everybody else just has a football or basketball jersey on.
My uncle, his daughter's getting married.
He has his tuxedo jacket, pants, cummerbund, bowtie.
No shirt.
They forgot his shirt, and instead of waiting to go get it, he was like, "Let's do it without it."
Right?
Like, that's... And he doesn't have a body that's like, "That's cool, man."
You know?
He has a body that you're like, "Put your jacket on backwards.
Flip it around."
Yeah.
Then you see his back, and you're like, "Oof.
All right, go back to regular way.
Yeah, that's my fault.
I didn't... How's your back worse than your front?"
Uh...

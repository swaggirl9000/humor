If you really want to piss off a really hot girl, like a model-hot girl, go onto her social media, find a photo where she looks smoking hot, and you're just a regular girl.
Go onto her comments and just be like, "People say I look just like you."
She'll be like, "No!"
Do you know that women Botox their armpits?
This is an actual thing.
It's not to make them look youthful, you know.
"Hi, everyone, same old me."
It's actually to stop them from sweating, because why would you, you know, as a human?
But the reason I know about it is I met a girl who did it, and she was like, "It worked.
I did stop sweating out of my armpits, but I started sweating out of my butthole."
So, I'm... uh... Is that a good trade?
like, kind of a deal with the devil.
Then I'm imagining the guy that sees her out somewhere and is just like... "Oh, ho, ho, ho."
He's like... [constricted laughter] He's like, [surfer voice] "She is so fucking hot.
Her armpits are bone-fucking-dry... just like I always dreamed of."
Then he's like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
That's him slipping on her butt sweat.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
He's like, "I'm so drawn to you, but I can't get near you!
This is a whole new kind of juicy booty."
[audience cheers and applauds] He's a surfer.
That's his profession.
Why just because you go onto the ocean on a thingy... do you have a dialect?
Why just 'cause you have an athletic skill set, do you laugh like... [constricted laughter] It's like, "Just stop making such a tight circle with your mouth... and then more laugh sounds could get out."

I don't know what happened.
All I did was eat abusively for 40 years.
And suddenly I'm fat?
That doesn't seem fair.
I am now at the size, when I go in clothing stores sales people look at me like, "We got nothing for you.
And you can't use our bathroom."
When I go out to eat, if I order a salad, the waiter's always like, "Aw.
Look at you try."
I'm always afraid he's gonna gather the whole staff, "The fat pig is trying, the fat pig is trying, I..." I've always talked about my weight in my stand up but in the past after shows if I ran into audience members they'd be like, "Jim, you're not that fat, you're not that fat."
But now after shows people are like, "Good show."
"You nailed it."
I don't care.
I like to eat!
I like to eat.
You know, when you like to eat, what's weird is people assume you enjoy cooking.
(audience laughs) Well, you must know your way around the kitchen.
I know where the food is.
Well, you must love to cook.
Look, I like to sleep.
It doesn't mean I wanna build a bed.The truth is, I don't like to do anything.
Like when I order delivery, I'm kind of annoyed they don't know what I want already.
What, do I have to do everything?

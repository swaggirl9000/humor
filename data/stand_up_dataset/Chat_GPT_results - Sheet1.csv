Jimmy_Yang,"Asian people, we don’t need Tinder anymore. We just go to BTS concerts. That’s how we do that parking lot pimping."
Jimmy_Yang,"I’ve been dating a lot of tall girls lately, because it makes me look successful. No, no. I think tall women are beautiful. But some of them like to wear heels. That’s just disrespect. Like, you’re already five inches taller than me. Why the fuck are you wearing heels?"
Jimmy_Yang,"She’s like, it makes my ass look better. I’m like, your ass is at my eye level right now. Neither of us look good, OK? I look like a child, and you look like a child molester."
Jimmy_Yang,"Last time– the last time I took a tall girl to this concert– I don’t know if you guys know this, but apparently, tall people have fun at concerts. Are you guys aware of that?"
Jimmy_Yang,I’m 5′ 5″. I just go to concerts to smell other people’s armpits. I’m like what the fuck’s the point of this?
Jimmy_Yang,"She was having the time of her life, doing whatever tall people do at concerts, you know, jumping around, obstructing other people’s views, seeing everything."
Jimmy_Yang,"I was frustrated. I had enough. So I just looked up at her, I was like, hey! Pick me up. This is bullshit. I paid for these tickets, OK? I want to see Billy Eilish, too. Come on."
Russell_Peters,"He goes, look, you’re a 48-year-old Indian man. I’m like, that’s really fucking racist, but since you asked, I have acid reflux."
Russell_Peters,There is no way you can be Indian and not have fucking acid reflux. It’s inevitable.
Russell_Peters,"There’s no way you can consume the food that we eat with that much spice, and that much oil, and that much butter, and not just have it burn a hole in your– as my dad would say– your esophagus."
Russell_Peters,"Dad, I want to assure you I have no phagus in me. No, no, son, esophagus. I don’t care whose phagus you think this is."
Russell_Peters,"I’m looking at all of you, especially all the pudgy guys. You know exactly who has it. You got it, don’t you, yellow guy? You do, do you. He’s like, I know, I have it, but I don’t want to say because my shirt looks like turmeric."
John_Mulaney,"We made these big piles of clothes, we put the piles into these big boxes, then we put the boxes into the back of my car, and then they stayed there for four months."
John_Mulaney,"One day my wife said, 'Hey, you took that stuff to Goodwill, right?' And I said, 'Of course I did! On an unrelated note, I’m going to walk out the front door right now.'"
John_Mulaney,"It was charitable, but it was also fast and violent, because I was throwing boxes at people."
John_Mulaney,"The boxes were so heavy I couldn’t even say what was in them. I was like, 'This one’s shirts. I got a bunch of shirts! Take ’em away!"
John_Mulaney,"The guy tried to give me a big receipt. He’s like, 'Take this receipt for the clothing for your taxes.' How do I write that on my taxes? 'Dear IRS, please deduct from my federal income tax one XXL Billabong T-shirt from youth. It was too big. My mom said it could be a sleep shirt. Please deduct this from my 2017 income.'"
John_Mulaney,"That sleep shirt bullshit. 'Well, if it’s too big you can just wear it as a sleep shirt.' No, I get that, Mom, but why don’t we just tell our relatives that I’m a four-year-old boy and I don’t wear a man’s XXL T-shirt?"
John_Mulaney,"Because we don’t say that when someone gives us a gift because that would not be polite.' Oh, I get it. So rather than violate these meaningless politeness rules, I’ll just go to bed in a smock like goddamn Ebenezer Scrooge."
John_Mulaney,Why don’t you give me a candle for looking in the mirror and a floppy hat and I’ll tremble off to bed in my long Victorian nightgown?
John_Mulaney,"Was there ever even a ghost, Mother, or was the dead Victorian girl you saw just me all along?"
Ali_Wong,"The last time I was at home in San Francisco, I was trying to help her get rid of shit. Don't ever do that with your mom. It was like the worst experience of my life."""
Ali_Wong,It was so emotional. We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82... manual. The manual. She don't even know... where the calculator is.
Ali_Wong,Those of you under 25 probably don't know what that calculator is. It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eighth grade. It cost like $200.
Ali_Wong,And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson's laptop from the future. All because what? It could graph. It was like the Tesla of my time.
Ali_Wong,"And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, 'You never know when you might need this.'"
Ali_Wong,"And I was like, 'But... I do know... that I'm gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.'"
Ali_Wong,"And I'm not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that's not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success."
Hasan_Minhaj,Have you seen the show called The Slap? This is a real show on NBC. This is a real show about a white kid that gets slapped at a birthday party. Are you fucking kidding? Thirteen episodes for this kid? Are you kidding me?
Hasan_Minhaj,"Do you know when brown kids get slapped? Every brown birthday party. And usually it’s the kid whose birthday it is, and we stand there and point and laugh. We go, 'Ah, Biju got slapped on his birthday!'"
Hasan_Minhaj,And that’s what makes us tough and resilient. It’s why we become cardiologists and win spelling bees. Slapping is important. It elevates your game.
Hasan_Minhaj,You ever seen an Indian kid win a spelling bee? Incredible! Ice water in the veins. That kid won’t choke on camera. He’s been slapped on camera.
Hasan_Minhaj,"Of course he can spell 'knaidel'. Knaidel. Look at that face. Nothing. Nothing! He’s 12 years old. Nothing! This kid just won $30,000 cash. Nothing"
Hasan_Minhaj,"People ask, 'Where does that come from?' Look at this kid’s parents. Your son just won the Scripps National Spelling Bee. Look at his brother. His brother is like, 'I’m fucked. I’m fucked. The bar is way too high. I should kill myself.'"
Hasan_Minhaj,"People say, 'Where’s Bobby Jindal from?' That’s where he comes from. That is an Indian sociopath."

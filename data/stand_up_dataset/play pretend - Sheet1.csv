Anthony_Jeselnik,My mom actually should’ve been on one of the planes that crashed on 9/11.

Anthony_Jeselnik,My mom would act weird when I brought a black friend over.

Anthony_Jeselnik,"I never get to see my family anymore, really."
Anthony_Jeselnik,My testimony.
Anthony_Jeselnik_2,I've never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money. How should I handle this?

Ali_Wong,It was like the worst experience of my life.
Ali_Wong,The manual. She don\'t even know where the calculator is.

Ali_Wong,"And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, ‘You never know when you might need this."
Ali_Wong_2,I’m just kidding. She doesn’t have any black friends.
Ali_Wong_2,"Old Asian ladies, they don’t give a fuck. They got no shame. They’re like, ‘I’m just gonna recycle… go bald… go to the park, do this shit."

Chelsea_Peretti,"It\'s like that wedding portraiture, where it\'s just like, two assholes back to back in the woods, just like… \'To the future!\' I\'m just obsessed with the entire photoset. I\'m just like, \'Next, next, next, next, more, more, more, more.\"
Chelsea_Peretti,"That same girl on Facebook, all her posts and all her updates are about her husband. That\'s all she seems to write or think about, but she doesn\'t call him her husband, which would be awesome, and she"
Chelsea_Peretti_2,People say I look just like you.
Chelsea_Peretti_2,"It's actually to stop them from sweating, because why would you, you know, as a human?"
Chelsea_Peretti_2,"It worked. I did stop sweating out of my armpits, but I started sweating out of my butthole"
Chelsea_Peretti_2,"I\'m so drawn to you, but I can\'t get near you! This is a whole new kind of juicy booty"
Donald_Glover,"I was like, what the fuck is wrong with this kid? What’s going on with this kid?"
Donald_Glover,The sweetest thing he was allowed was mints
Donald_Glover,"It was crazy. I would take him to the park, right? Washington Square Park, and all the babysitters in New York for some reason are Trinidadian. They’re all Trinidadian babysitters."
Donald_Glover_2,"Oh, this is awful, this is so messed up. I can’t believe this happened so close to us"
Donald_Glover_2,"Yeah, well, “if anybody ever tries to rape me, I’m just gonna shit on ’em."

Hasan_Minhaj,"""Are you fucking kidding? Thirteen episodes for this kid? Are you kidding me? Do you know when br0wn kids get slapped? Every br0wn birthday party."

Iliza_Shlesinger,The beginning of a relationship is the most exciting part of the relationship.
Iliza_Shlesinger,"It’s interesting, in your 20s, it’s a weird mental game. Boy’s coming over for the first time, you’re trying to reconcile the beautiful home that your mother kept that you lived in growing up, with the beautiful home that, like, Pinterest says you’re supposed to have."
Iliza_Shlesinger,"You want him to come in and be, like, “It’s so homey. I’d like to stay forever.” Yes, come"

Iliza_Shlesinger_2,"You don’t want to wear your civilian clothes, okay.""\n- ""I don’t mean no, but… no means no."
Iliza_Shlesinger_2,"It’s frustrating. You know, girls, it’d be like if you have the worst day, you came home to your boyfriend, like… ‘I had the worst day. I got fired, and… I cried in front of everyone and… I ate that French fry from my car. It was just such a hard"
Jim_Gaffigan,"That doesn’t seem fair. I am now at the size, when I go in clothing stores sales people look at me like, “We got nothing for you. And you can’t use our bathroom.”"
Jim_Gaffigan,"I like to sleep. It doesn’t mean I wanna build a bed. The truth is, I don’t like to do anything."
Jim_Gaffigan,"Well, you must love to cook. Look, I like to sleep. It doesn’t mean I wanna build a bed."
Jim_Gaffigan_2,"That’s not how dogs keep track of time. If you have a dog, you know they don’t keep track of time."

Jim_Gaffigan_2,The dog didn’t know it was his birthday. The dog didn’t know it had a birthday. The dog wasn’t sure why people were in the apartment.
Joe_List,"I\'m Bill, this is Susan, and Ted. ""Ear, nose, throat. ""Who do ya need?"
Joe_List,Tin-uh-dus. That\'s when you\'re ears ring. You got it?
Joe_List,This guy\'s a fake ass fucking retard doctor. It\'s pronounced t-ah-n-i-tus.
Joe_List,"Tomato, to-mah-to. However you say it. If you have it, don\'t go to the doctor, they don\'t do shit"

John_Mulaney_2,"Detective JJ Bittenbinder wore three-piece suits. He also wore a pocket watch. Two years in a row, he wore a cowboy hat. He also had a huge handlebar mustache. None of that matters, but it’s important to me that you know that."
John_Mulaney_2,He did not look like his job description. He looked like he should be the conductor on a locomotive powered by confetti.
Jimmy_Yang,"Asian people, we don’t need Tinder anymore. We just go to BTS concerts. That’s how we do that parking lot pimping."
Jimmy_Yang,I’m 5′ 5″. I just go to concerts to smell other people’s armpits.
Jimmy_Yang,Are you guys aware of that? I’m 5′ 5″. I just go to concerts to smell other people’s armpits.
Jimmy_Yang_2,"Old Asian people, they don’t watch TV. They judge the TV."""
Jimmy_Yang_2,"He’s just sitting there, arms folded, judging the TV like–He’s made some random noises around the house."
Jimmy_Yang_2,"It’s just like, achoo! Oh! Ay, shit.Oh! I’m like, what the fuck, Dad, just have an orgasm? What was that?"
Jimmy_Yang_2,He doesn’t understand what I’m saying half the time
Louis_CK,He was?
Louis_CK,I don't think so.
Louis_CK,"That\'s okay, it already happened."
Louis_CK,"You fucking think about it, you idiot. What d– What was he then? You\'re… What, was he Presbyterian? What was he? Catholic? Okay, Jesus was Catholic and he had a gold chain with a cross."
Louis_CK,That finally makes sense. I didn\'t even know
Louis_CK_2,"Dogs are so dumb, it’s fucking tragic."

Nate_Bargatze,"She watches kids playing with toys. Like, that\'s what\'s crazy."
Nate_Bargatze_2,Homework\'s fun. First and second grade was awesome.
Nate_Bargatze_2,"Okay, learning it earlier than we used to, huh?"
Nate_Bargatze_2,"It\'s a whole new... I mean, it\'s unbelievable. They bring it home, you gotta watch a 40-minute YouTube video on Common Core math."
Nate_Bargatze_2,Oh! Just do that at the top. I don\'t even know what we\'re doing.
Nate_Bargatze_2,It\'s a long way to get at the same answer.
Nate_Bargatze_TK,"It goes clown, then magic."
Nate_Bargatze_TK,The Easter Bunny was in the passenger seat
Nate_Bargatze_TK,"Like, he couldn't sit normal, so his head was bent to the side."
Nate_Bargatze_TK_2,We gotta be there Monday for this wedding? It’s a week?
Nate_Bargatze_TK_2,Let’s do it without it.

Sam_Morril,"That is male privilege right there, isn’t it? I just told a room full of people I got roofied. I did not see one concerned face in here"
Sam_Morril,It’s hard not to drink man. It’s very hard. I work in a place where there’s a bar every night. I’ve been trying to be good. It’s very difficult.
Sam_Morril,"I brought my Wilson racket and everything. You tell me to replace an addiction with cardio, that’s very helpful."
Sam_Morril_2,"Isn’t that weird that they can do anti-smoking ads, but you can’t do pro-cigarette commercials?"
Sam_Morril_2,"There at the end, it just says, ‘Wouldn’t kill you to carry a pack,’ you know?"
Sam_Morril_2,"I’m two to three abortions away from Diamond Medallion status, so… I’m losing some of you, but I’m gonna take it a step further here."
Sam_Morril_2,"I got greedy, guys, I did."

Trevor_Noah,I don’t want dance with you. Please!
Trevor_Noah,"Hey, you don’t gotta be such a bitch!"
Trevor_Noah_2,You can\'t do normal things with that voice. You are destined for greatness.
Trevor_Noah_2,"It just doesn\'t work. I remember when Nelson Mandela was still alive, and he would tell jokes at press conferences and events, and no one would laugh. Because everyone thought a man who had been in jail for 27 years couldn\'t make a joke."
Trevor_Noah_2,"Everything he did, he’d just be like, ‘Ah, knock, knock.’ People would be like, ‘Let him in. Let him in!’ ‘No. No'"
Tom_Segura,"The most terrifying housing situation that exists. Where other trailer people are like, “Get the fuck out of here.” Kick ’em out."
Tom_Segura,We just need to go get it. 
Tom_Segura,That\'s what\'s up.
Tom_Segura,Can we get a description before we agree to terms? How about a height and weight on old mom?
Tom_Segura_2,"I was trying to figure out, “Why does this feel so good?” I think it’s a taste of power. Like most of us, we have no power in our everyday lives. But if you’re alone in an elevator, -you are lord of the elevator shaft. You get to decide, like a king with his drawbridge."
Tom_Segura_2,"Sometimes, a second later it opens, and you’re like, “Fuck!” You get nervous energy, like you’re a kid. You’re like, “I’m in trouble."

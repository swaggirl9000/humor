comedian,sentence
Anthony_Jeselnik,"So poor I remember, just so I could go to my senior prom, I had to sell my U.S. passport on the street. Sold my passport on the street for 300 bucks to get to go to my prom."
Anthony_Jeselnik,"Of course this was before 9/11 so… my bad, everybody. Weird joke to clap for, but sure."
Anthony_Jeselnik,My mom actually should’ve been on one of the planes that crashed on 9/11. I think.
Anthony_Jeselnik,"""Once in a while, I’d bring a black friend over. And when I did that, my mom would act weird. She’d pull me aside and say, 'Anthony, who’s your new friend? Is he a drug dealer?' And I would say, 'Shut up, Mom, that’s racist. Put your money away.'"
Anthony_Jeselnik,"Most of them are in jail, to be honest. And we never talk, write letters or any of that shit. ‘Cause they’re all in jail for the exact same thing. My testimony."
Anthony_Jeselnik_2,I am a pure comedian. I think I’m one of the best comedians of all time.
Anthony_Jeselnik_2,"No one should ever ask me to speak at anyone’s funeral. I asked a friend for advice. Was like, 'I’ve never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money. How should I handle this?'"
Anthony_Jeselnik_2,"And don’t tell a joke. Try not to."""
Anthony_Jeselnik_2,"And I know my grandma loved it too, because it combined her two favorite things: spending time with her grandchildren, and using the ‘N’ word."
Anthony_Jeselnik_2,"Now I promise you… I promise you… until you’ve heard your grandfather gasp at his own wife’s funeral… …at a Methodist Church in Vicksburg, Mississippi… you are not a real comedian."
Anthony_Jeselnik_3,My mom and dad once made me smoke an entire pack of cigarettes. An entire pack of cigarettes in one sitting. Just to teach me an important lesson about brand loyalty.
Anthony_Jeselnik_3,"But I learned something. Because the next time I got a bad report card in school, I brought it home and I gave it to my mom. Let her take the hit."
Anthony_Jeselnik_3,My dad was a hard-ass. One of those guys who believed that men just learn by doing things. You know? You don’t take classes. You don’t read the instructions. You just do it and figure it out.
Anthony_Jeselnik_3,"Like, when I was a kid, I never got to take swimming lessons. No, my dad would pick me up and throw me in the water to teach himself CPR."
Ali_Wong,It all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82… manual. The manual. She don’t even know… where the calculator is.
Ali_Wong,It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eighth grade. It cost like $200. And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson’s laptop from the future. All because what? It could graph.
Ali_Wong,"And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, 'You never know when you might need this.' And I was like, 'But… I do know… that I’m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.'"
Ali_Wong,"And I’m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that’s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success."
Ali_Wong_2,"My mom is 80, going through a full-blown mid-life crisis. ‘Cause she knows that she’s got a century more to go."
Ali_Wong_2,"All of her white friends, dead. Her Mexican friends, dead. Black friends, dead. I’m just kidding. She doesn’t have any black friends."
Ali_Wong_2,"Life is not Rush Hour, the movie, OK?"
Ali_Wong_2,"I need children to be there for me when I’m older, when I get as old as her. And when I say be there for me, I mean pay for me when my husband isn’t around to support me anymore."
Ali_Wong_2,"I’m not trying to be one of those old Chinese ladies who recycles for a living. That’s not my destiny, OK?"
Ali_Wong_2,"Old Chinese ladies, they don’t give a fuck. They got no shame. They’re like, 'I’m just gonna recycle… go bald… go to the park, do this shit.'"
Ali_Wong_2,"They do it in their– their big-ass V. Stiviano visor, their Darth Vader-Tomb Raider-Boba Fett helmet. They wear that to protect themselves from their arch-nemesis, the sun."
Ali_Wong_2,Old Asian ladies and the sun are like the Tupac and Biggie of longevity.
Ali_Wong_3,You go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in America and that shit is turning into a Yoko Ono factory.
Ali_Wong_3,"I get it, you know, because being with a white dude you feel very… You feel very picturesque when you’re with a white dude, you know. You feel like you’re in a Wes Anderson movie or something."
Ali_Wong_3,"And you know, white dudes, they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling, and disturbing documentaries."
Ali_Wong_3,"I mean, nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy. Oh, my God. I just feel like I’m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement… …you know, just right there, through the money hole and just…"
Ali_Wong_3,"I’m, like, 'I could just crush your head at any moment, white man! I could just kill you right now! Crush those brains! Colonize the colonizer!"
Chelsea_Peretti,"It’s like that wedding portraiture, where it’s just like, two assholes back to back in the woods, just like… [laughing shrilly] 'To the future!"
Chelsea_Peretti,"Every photo, they were just like… [giggles shrilly] 'Uh-oh, it’s us again.' [trills]"
Chelsea_Peretti,"She calls him by a word that I really feel is one of the more disgusting words in the English language. She calls him her 'hubby,' which, to me is on par with the 'N' word. Like let’s… Let’s eradicate both."
Chelsea_Peretti,"My hubby made breakfast. My hubby fixed the door. My hubby is sleeping. He breathed in, he breathed out. He breathed in, he breathed out."
Chelsea_Peretti,"I just keep waiting for the day where she is like, 'My hubby shot himself in the face! His letter said he missed his name… which I just found out is Steven. Missing my hub like a mug.'"
Chelsea_Peretti_2,"If you really want to piss off a really hot girl, like a model-hot girl, go onto her social media, find a photo where she looks smoking hot, and you’re just a regular girl. Go onto her comments and just be like, 'People say I look just like you.' She’ll be like, 'No!'"
Chelsea_Peretti_2,"Do you know that women Botox their armpits? This is an actual thing. It’s not to make them look youthful, you know. 'Hi, everyone, same old me.' It’s actually to stop them from sweating, because why would you, you know, as a human?"
Chelsea_Peretti_2,"It worked. I did stop sweating out of my armpits, but I started sweating out of my butthole."
Chelsea_Peretti_2,"He’s like, 'She is so fucking hot. Her armpits are bone-fucking-dry… just like I always dreamed of.' Then he’s like, 'Whoa, whoa, whoa!' That’s him slipping on her butt sweat."
Chelsea_Peretti_2,This is a whole new kind of juicy booty.
Chelsea_Peretti_2,"Why just because you go onto the ocean on a thingy… do you have a dialect? Why just ’cause you have an athletic skill set, do you laugh like… [constricted laughter] It’s like, 'Just stop making such a tight circle with your mouth… and then more laugh sounds could get out.'"
Chelsea_Peretti_3,"Like that feeling you get when one of your friends leaves their phone or their laptop unattended, and they do not have a password on it, like a dummy."
Chelsea_Peretti_3,It’s what I imagine hunting and gathering felt like. I was just like… [gasps] 'But this could sustain my spirit for two weeks!'
Chelsea_Peretti_3,"I went onto Twitter. I’m like, 'My dick hurts.' Then I was just like… [humming triumphant tune] I went onto Facebook. I was like, 'My dick hurts.'"
Chelsea_Peretti_3,"People just like, 'Dude, what’s up with your dick? We’re worried about you.'"
Chelsea_Peretti_3,"It’s just weird that any news story that goes online, it’s like any shithead can just write [grunts] 'Here’s my thoughts.'"
Chelsea_Peretti_3,"If Einstein had been a young scientist, you know, maybe he would have posted a little theorem up on some science website, just like, 'E equals… I’m not sure yet.'"
Chelsea_Peretti_3,"The first comment would have been like, 'What’s up, Jew-fro?! You Jew-ass bitch! Jew, Jew, Jew, bitch, Jew, bitch, Jew.'"
Chelsea_Peretti_3,"Einstein would have just been like, 'Oh, I’m not gonna do science anymore. It’s too hurtful.' Just pack up his little beakers and hit the road. Maybe get a job at Kiehl’s."
Chelsea_Peretti_3,"Did he use beakers? I don’t know. Like, what did he do? He invented wing sauce?"
Donald_Glover,"I opened the door and there were tears streaming down his face, tears streaming down his face, but he wasn’t crying. He wasn’t crying. Just tears, he was giving me this mean mug, he was like… I was like, what the fuck is wrong with this kid?"
Donald_Glover,The sweetest thing he was allowed was mints. He was just allowed to have mints. So he would steal mints by the handful. So his breath was so fresh… the vapors from his own mouth made his eyes water.
Donald_Glover,"He’d be like, 'Hello!' And then like… Just, they would just bleed… It was crazy."
Donald_Glover,All the babysitters in New York for some reason are Trinidadian. They’re all Trinidadian babysitters.
Donald_Glover,"He goes, 'Suck my d!ck!' And the lady goes… I shit you not… The lady goes, 'Someone betta get this little niglet away from me.'"
Donald_Glover_2,"If anybody ever tries to rape me, I’m just gonna shit on ’em. Yes, I will. I have no problem."
Donald_Glover_2,"Number one, he’s a rapist. So his tolerance for gross stuff is probably pretty high. It’s probably pretty high."
Donald_Glover_2,"Number two… you can shit on command? Like, you can just… You can just poop whenever you want to?"
Donald_Glover_2,"You’re a national treasure. Like, you can… You got more superpowers than Shaft if you can poop whenever you want."
Donald_Glover_2,"Somebody can run down… down the stage right now and pull out a gun and be like, 'Shit yourself! Poop yourself right now!' I’d be like, 'Blow my head off.' I can’t do it, I can’t do it."
Donald_Glover_2,"Me and my butt are, like, always on the third date, I feel like. I feel like, me, I’m always like, come on, let’s… hurry up, let’s do this. And my butt’s always like, stop rushing me, when the time is right. I’m not in love yet."""
Donald_Glover_2,That was me in a domestic dispute with my… with my butt.
Donald_Glover_3,"People always want to know who can say the N-word and who can’t say the N-word. You know, like people always… You know, I’ve got a lot of white friends. And they’re all just kind of like, 'Oh man, I wish I could say that stuff. It sounds so cool when you say it in rap songs. Like, I want to say that, it sounds cool.'"
Donald_Glover_3,"And I’m just like, oh, it doesn’t really, like, do anything… it’s not that great, you know?"
Donald_Glover_3,"So they hired a woman to do sign language with me for that joke, and she comes up to me and she goes, 'I’m sorry, but are there any terms or phrases in your act that don’t exist in sign language that I have to make up on the spot?' And I was like… 'Yeah. Niglet?'"
Donald_Glover_3,"And she goes, 'Oh.' There’s already a term for 'niglet' in sign language! They already have it! Deaf people have been saying 'niglet' for years! For years!"
Donald_Glover_3,"A ngga that is tiny, that’s what that means! Was it… Why is this 'ngga'? Why is this… This is… I feel like it should be… Or… Way, way before this."
Donald_Glover_3,"I’ve done this walking down the street. Like, when my nose itches, I’ve done that and I feel like deaf people were looking at me like, 'That motherfucker’s racist.' 'That guy hates his own people.'"
Hasan_Minhaj,Have you seen the show called The Slap? This is a real show on NBC. This is a real show about a white kid that gets slapped at a birthday party. Are you fucking kidding? Thirteen episodes for this kid? Are you kidding me?
Hasan_Minhaj,"Do you know when br0wn kids get slapped? Every br0wn birthday party. And usually it’s the kid whose birthday it is, and we stand there and point and laugh. We go, 'Ah, Biju got slapped on his birthday!'"
Hasan_Minhaj,And that’s what makes us tough and resilient. It’s why we become cardiologists and win spelling bees. Slapping is important. It elevates your game.
Hasan_Minhaj,You ever seen an Indian kid win a spelling bee? Incredible! Ice water in the veins. That kid won’t choke on camera. He’s been slapped on camera.
Hasan_Minhaj,"Of course he can spell 'knaidel'. Knaidel. Look at that face. Nothing. Nothing! He’s 12 years old. Nothing! This kid just won $30,000 cash. Nothing."
Hasan_Minhaj,"His brother is like, 'I’m fucked. I’m fucked. The bar is way too high. I should kill myself.'"
Hasan_Minhaj,"People say, 'Where’s Bobby Jindal from?' That’s where he comes from. That is an Indian sociopath. That guy hates his own people."
Hasan_Minhaj_2,"Alright, you guys are all killing it academically but I want you to know there is more to life than just getting into UC Berkeley."
Hasan_Minhaj_2,"One kid was like, “I know, getting into Stanford.”"
Hasan_Minhaj_2,"“All 30 of us? We’re all going to prom? AP Calc? Us? Me, Jehovah’s Witness girl, Korean exchange students, going to the prom? Thirty for 30? All of us?”"
Hasan_Minhaj_2,"He walks over to the board, he pulls it down. It’s a bracket with everybody’s name on it leading up to the big dance. It’s March Madness for nerds."
Hasan_Minhaj_2,"“Whatever, it’s not going to happen. He can’t do this.” That guy hates his own people.”"
Hasan_Minhaj_3,"""I’m the only br0wn kid at school, Dad is the only br0wn guy at work. In a weird way that brings us together, and we have to do everything together."""
Hasan_Minhaj_3,"""Try to understand immigrant fathers. I still can’t understand some of you. There are uncles here. None of you guys are smiling. I don’t get it. You’re going to die. Laugh. Why aren’t you laughing?"""
Hasan_Minhaj_3,"You could wake up any immigrant father from a 12-hour nap, and they’d say… [angry yawn] 'Why do I have to pay taxes?'"
Hasan_Minhaj_3,"And I’d look at him and be like, 'Oh, man. Dad hates yogurt.' [laughter] 'He hates milk.'"
Hasan_Minhaj_3,Then I would trip on my Velcro shoes and I would drop the soda and it would explode. And then my dad would do what most br0wn parents do. He would check to see if the coast is clear… and he’d slap the shit out of me.
Hasan_Minhaj_3,Americans hit on the arm and bruise the body. Immigrants slap your face and bruise your soul. It’s Guantanamo of the mind.
Hasan_Minhaj_3,"And I know some of you guys are like, 'Hey, this is Davis, okay? I listen to NPR. Ira Glass says children are our future.' That guy hates his own people."
Iliza_Shlesinger,"Granted, I’m not married yet, so, technically, I’ve only had beginnings of relationships. I don’t know. I can’t say empirically how fun being married is. I’ll tell you on the next comedy special what that’s all about."
Iliza_Shlesinger,"You’re both on your best behavior, it’s still electric, you’re not totally sure about the history of mental illness in each family. It’s fun."
Iliza_Shlesinger,"You want him to come in and be, like, 'It’s so homey. I’d like to stay forever.' Yes, come closer. Like, that’s what you want."
Iliza_Shlesinger,"In your 30s, homeboy knocks on the door, you open it, you’re in combat boots, nothing else, and a garbage can on fire, you’re, like, 'Welcome to Fuckdome, Scott.'"
Iliza_Shlesinger,Should I buy a rug or eat dinner? I don’t know. It’s so hard.
Iliza_Shlesinger_2,"You don’t want to wear your daytime clothes, ’cause… ’cause it’s nighttime. What if that was the end of my show? I hit my head."
Iliza_Shlesinger_2,"You don’t want to wear nipple tassels. Now… some women are, like, 'Wait a minute.'"
Iliza_Shlesinger_2,"You show up in that, he’ll be, like, 'Oh, my god!' The blood’s gonna go from here to his dick, he’s gonna impale himself, he’s gonna sue you, and you ain’t got no money."
Iliza_Shlesinger_2,"It’d be like if you have the worst day, you came home to your boyfriend, like… 'I had the worst day. I got fired, and… I cried in front of everyone and… I ate that French fry from my car.'"
Iliza_Shlesinger_2,"Your boyfriend’s like, 'Aw, babe. You want to talk about it?' You’re, like, 'Yeah.' He’s, like, 'Just kidding. Psych.'"
Iliza_Shlesinger_3,"We’re judging your hair, your shoes, we scan you, like Predator. Every atom, every molecule of your DNA, we go through it like… 'Scanning for physical abnormalities.'"
Iliza_Shlesinger_3,"Is he balding? Is that a goatee? Is his shirt unbuttoned too low for his ethnicity? Is he wearing embroidered jeans? If so, is he a European male or just someone from Arizona?"
Iliza_Shlesinger_3,We aren’t looking to see if you’re the hottest guy ever. Nay. We are merely assessing if you’re 50% attractive enough that we want to put the effort into putting ourselves in your orbit.
Iliza_Shlesinger_3,"So that, in an hour, after a drink or two, you, gentlemen, have the luxury of turning around and being, like, 'Oh, excuse me, I couldn’t help but notice.'"
Iliza_Shlesinger_3,"Then we turn around, like… Really? That’s it. Just set it up for you to knock it down."
Jim_Gaffigan,All I did was eat abusively for 40 years. And suddenly I’m fat? That doesn’t seem fair.
Jim_Gaffigan,"When I go in clothing stores, salespeople look at me like, 'We got nothing for you. And you can’t use our bathroom.'"
Jim_Gaffigan,"When I go out to eat, if I order a salad, the waiter’s always like, 'Aw. Look at you try.'"
Jim_Gaffigan,"I’ve always talked about my weight in my stand-up, but in the past after shows, if I ran into audience members, they’d be like, 'Jim, you’re not that fat, you’re not that fat.' But now after shows, people are like, 'Good show.' 'You nailed it.'"
Jim_Gaffigan,"You know, when you like to eat, what’s weird is people assume you enjoy cooking. Well, you must know your way around the kitchen. I know where the food is."
Jim_Gaffigan,"When I order delivery, I’m kind of annoyed they don’t know what I want already. What, do I have to do everything?"
Jim_Gaffigan,"Look, I like to sleep. It doesn’t mean I wanna build a bed."
Jim_Gaffigan_2,"Recently, I was invited to a surprise birthday party. It was a surprise birthday party for a dog. That’s right, I have friends that are mentally ill."
Jim_Gaffigan_2,"And to be fair, the dog was surprised. Didn’t suspect a thing. Dog didn’t know it was his birthday. The dog didn’t know it had a birthday."
Jim_Gaffigan_2,"It was the dog’s third birthday, which in dog years doesn’t matter. Someone made that up and we just went along with it."
Jim_Gaffigan_2,"Oh, one year equals seven for doggies? Okay. When I see a dog, I’ll do math. That’s not fulfilling some dog need, you know?"
Jim_Gaffigan_2,"There’s not a dog sitting in a bar right now going, 'I’m not three, I’m 21! I can legally drink!'"
Jim_Gaffigan_2,"You’ve left your home, forgotten something, walked back in only to be greeted by your dog like you’ve just returned from war. 'You’re back! It’s a miracle! You’re back after I don’t know how long ’cause I’m a dog.'"
Jim_Gaffigan_3,"Alaska’s beautiful. My kids were havin’ fun. I was pretending like I enjoyed being outside."""
Jim_Gaffigan_3,"And then suddenly we saw a bear, like, 500 yards away, this huge brown bear, like, way bigger than a gummy bear."
Jim_Gaffigan_3,"I was like, 'Oh my God, I’ve watched you on Animal Planet. You’re so much taller in person. Can we do a selfie?'"
Jim_Gaffigan_3,"But unlike a celebrity sighting, there was the risk of death. Like, you never hear, we’re in a restaurant, Tom Hanks walked in and then he came over and murdered my family. That never happens."
Jim_Gaffigan_3,"Started creeping towards me, tilting his head back and forth almost like he recognized me. 'That guy looks like Phillip Seymour Hoffman.'"
Jim_Gaffigan_3,Do you have anything stronger? Like a bear gun? ‘Cause I don’t think this bear’s approaching to get his hair done.'
Joe_List,"It’s one doctor. He knows all three body parts. I was hoping it was three doctors saving money, by sharing a small office. He’s like, 'I’m Bill, this is Susan, and Ted. Ear, nose, throat. Who do ya need?'"
Joe_List,"I have an ear issue called, tinnitus, or tin-uh-dus. That’s when you’re ears ring. You got it? Yeah, it’s frustrating. It’s when you’re ears ring, or buzz all the time."
Joe_List,"I watched a YouTube video, and the doctor in the video, he kept saying 'tin-uh-dus.' And so I was like, 'Oh, I guess it’s pronounced tin-uh-dus.' But then I went to the comments section, and the first comment said, 'This guy’s a fake ass fucking retard doctor. It’s pronounced t-ah-n-i-tus.' All caps."
Joe_List,"This gentlemen is a doctor, he seems very smart. This fella seems, less smart, but, extremely adamant about the pronunciation of this word."
Joe_List,"My hearing is great. I hear everything, plus ringing, so. I kind of have superpower hearing, if you think about it. I’m hearing shit that’s not even in the room."
Joe_List_2,"You can be in the second to last row. This one guy behind, you’re like what a fucking idiot back there. Embarrassing, loser."
Joe_List_2,"""I wanted him to die, I swear to God. I was like, hope this guy passes away on the flight."""
Joe_List_2,"""First of all, you don’t need to make a noise when you yawn. That’s a decision, he’s deciding to do that."""
Joe_List_2,"""People who yawn out loud, they want attention. That’s why they’re doing it. They want you to be like, 'Oh, my God, are you tired?' And they’re like, I am, here’s my entire life story of how I came to be tired.'"""
Joe_List_2,"""You ever do that when someone was like, 'I had a wild night last night.' and then you’re like, 'Neat.' And then you just walked away. That’s like one of my favorite things to do."""
Joe_List_2,"""They were playing 'Welcome To The Jungle' by Guns N’ Roses at the airport. That’s a weird airport song. I’m a rock and roll guy. I love Guns N’ Roses, I’m cool. But it’s a little much at the airport."""
Joe_List_2,"""I’m eating a muffin, looking for an outlet. I don’t think we need to rock this hard."""
Joe_List_2,"""Also it’s a little unnerving to be boarding a flight. And hear, 'You’re gonna die!'"""
Joe_List_3,"""Mental and dental. No? Not a big, therapy, in New York too, oi. I love it. I can do it for ya. If you guys wanted to go, maybe you can’t afford it, I can do it for you. I didn’t go to college or anything, but I know how to do therapy. I’ve been going long enough."""
Joe_List_3,"""Whatever you’re dealing with, it’s because of your family. Look no further, than your own family. That’s all therapy is, you complain about your problems, then he says, 'It’s your family.' And then you’re like, 'Still, great.' Then you give him your money, and then you leave."""
Joe_List_3,"""At first I was skeptical. I was like, 'I don’t know.' And then I spent 11 seconds with my family, and I was like, 'He nailed it. These are the worst people I’ve ever met in my life. I don’t know how I didn’t see this earlier.'"""
Joe_List_3,"""She said, 'Joe, my biggest fear.' She told me her biggest fear. I didn’t ask her what her biggest fear was, because, I was eight years old. I did not give a shit about her fears, but, she told me anyway."""
Joe_List_3,"""She said, 'My biggest fear, is that when I go to the bathroom, they’ll be a man, hiding behind the shower curtain waiting to get me.' And I was like, 'Well, that’s my biggest fear now, also.'"""
Joe_List_3,"""Previously my biggest fear had been wetting my pants but, that’s now the solution, to avoiding my new biggest fear, entering the bathroom at my parents house."""
Joe_List_3,"""My parents are like, 'What do you want for your ninth birthday?' I’m like, 'How ’bout a urinal, in my bedroom, and, maybe a firearm, and a new babysitter. The big three.'"""
Joe_List_3,"""And then your bladder’s like, 'That’s all we know how to do. We just wanted to let you know we were helping, hell.' And then your colon’s like, 'We’re ready to rock also, if you want us to fire something up.'"""
Joe_List_3,"""Fortunately, my Aunt Betty was never attacked by a man, behind the shower curtain. Which is good. I mean it could still happen, she’s still alive. But probably won’t, she lives with her parents, they have a security system set up."""

John_Mulaney_2,You are told never to talk to an adult that you don’t know and you are told this by an adult that you don’t know.
John_Mulaney_2,"We had the same Stranger Danger speaker every year when I was a kid, his name was Detective JJ Bittenbinder. Go ahead and laugh. His name is ridiculous."
John_Mulaney_2,He’s still got blood on his shoes. And he’s looking at you in the eye to tell you for the first time in your very young life that some adults find you incredibly attractive. And they may just have to kill you over it.
John_Mulaney_2,"Okay, c’est la vie, go be kids, go have fun."
John_Mulaney_2,"Bittenbinder came every year. By the way, Detective JJ Bittenbinder wore three-piece suits. He also wore a pocket watch. Two years in a row, he wore a cowboy hat. He also had a huge handlebar mustache. None of that matters, but it’s important to me that you know that."

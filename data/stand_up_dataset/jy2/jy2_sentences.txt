See, I'm like first generation.
But my parents, they're like negative 9 generation, because they're so frickin' Chinese.
Like, it's really hard for me to watch TV with my dad, because he's trying to make me explain everything to him.
First of all, old Asian people, they don't watch TV.
They judge the TV.
This is like, I'm just sitting next to my dad on the couch, and he's wearing his, like, old Asian man costume, which is just a wife beater and tighty-whiteys.
He's just sitting there, arms folded, judging the TV like-He's made some random noises around the house.
Now whenever he sneezes, it's never just a sneeze.
It's like a whole tsunami of sound waves that comes after.
It's just like, achoo!
Oh!
Ay, shit.Oh!
I'm like, what the fuck, Dad, just have an orgasm?
What was that?And he doesn't understand what I'm saying half the time.
He's like, oh, there's an orgasm.
OK, the orga- orgasm.
